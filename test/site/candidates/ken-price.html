      <div id="about">
        Having grown up and always worked here, I'm keen to see our historical towns and beautiful natural environment preserved, even as we deal with the challenge of growth. 
I believe Council's first responsibility is to maintain our local services and infrastructure, rather than worrying ourselves over State and Federal government affairs - especially international ones.
I want to be part of a Council that keeps our services running, our environment clean, our roads graded/sealed, and our rates low.

          <div style="margin: 20px; margin-left: 0px;"><em><a href="https://dhelkayahealth.org.au/my-home-network/">My Home Network</a> is a local network made up of local people with lived experience of housing crisis and homelessness, community members with diverse expertise and community and government organisations. The network believes that everyone has a right to safe, affordable, secure, sustainable and appropriate housing that recognises their place in and connections to Community and Country.

Current work includes that of the  Homeshare community, tiny homes on wheels, tenants rights working group, vacant dwellings and advocacy working groups and rough sleeper action group and advocating for a Solar bank to ensure equitable access for all community members to affordable renewable energy.

The My Home Network works closely with Mount Alexander Shire Council across various departments and with the permanent full time housing solutions broker Clare Richards.

We support Council in their work to address the housing crisis -see Let's talk about affordable housing | Shape Mount Alexander which is essentially about bringing diverse social housing to Mount Alexander Shire (we need 600 more social housing units) and setting up a Mount Alexander Charitable  Affordable Housing Trust (MAAHT) .

They are also in the process of employing a Homelessness coordinator who will scope, support and coordinate formal and informal Homelessness supports in the Shire.</em></div>
