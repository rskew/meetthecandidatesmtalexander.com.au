                    I've had many opportunities to hear from and work with people who have very different values and opinions. Sometimes those views are expressed quite forcefully, and I not only seek to listen and bring others together, but I almost always enjoy the experience.

                    I believe a wide awareness of what is happening in our community (even amongst those who are not directly involved) is the most important thing. Council can support this by communicating frequently and widely, and encouraging the engagement of our whole community by showing how they can be involved.

                I believe a wide awareness of what is happening in our community (even amongst those who are not directly involved) is the most important thing. Council can support this by communicating frequently and widely, and encouraging the engagement of our whole community by showing how they can be involved.
