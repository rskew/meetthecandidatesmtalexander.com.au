        <p>First and foremost, I love where I live! I have walked this Country since I can remember and I have a deep connection to my home town, Fryerstown which I call ‘place of windy song’. I would like to see our environment being cared for, and healing of Country.  Through a First Nations and Council co-lead and co-designed biodiversity strategy we can create opportunities for all voices to be heard from our communities, including the youth voices, to hear what they see as important in looking after our environment and loving where we live. I am passionate about habitat for wildlife and maintaining small town character, including Aboriginal Cultural heritage and historical heritage, both are important and are a part of our shared history.</p><p></p><p>I also strongly believe that I would represent our ward through strong advocacy, transparency, whilst always maintaining our community values.</p>

How will you address this division and ensure there is accountability and transparency about the learning and truth telling that is needed? </p></i></div>
                  <div class="answer">
                    Yes, I hear you and feel you and all of what community is experiencing. As a First Nations woman who has children in the shire who has been subjected to racism, I believe in calling it out, standing strong and finding more opportunities for truth telling and educating our communities.

Through initiatives where First Nations people and allies/wider community to ‘koling wadangitj’ (walk together) as a collective.  
These could include school based initiatives to promote and support Indigenous education delivery in our local schools, working closely with the KESOs Korrie Education Support Officers, as well as other community initiatives like co-led, co-designed projects such as the Mount Alexander Shire Biodiversity strategy.

More signage, dual language places and interpretations of places and spaces within our shire which focus on First Nations stories and perspectives and then linking or noting the historical story of place with a narrative that does not erase or soften truth telling.

By committing to these seemingly small acts, this will promote and bring more awareness to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander presence in our community, and recognise/acknowledge our first peoples here, Djarra.

                    I believe in trying to find a middle ground and a way forward to walk together despite different perspectives and values.

I believe people who bring different perspectives or who see things through a different lens can often have a more creative and strengthened relationship which leads to amazing and ‘out of the box’ outcomes.

My working experience over the last 10 years has included working with people from all different backgrounds and differing opinions that has required maintaining a middle ground to reach a sustainable outcome for everyone.

                    A resilient community is one that ‘walks together’. In a perfect world resilience relies on positive and meaningful collaboration with one another, and deep listening to community.  A resilient community is one that has secure housing, safe places, accessibility to services such as advocacy  for all people. No one should be left behind.

                  <div class="answer">
                    I would strongly advocate for our ward and shire to be plastic bag free towns, more electric chargers for eco cars, more safe bike lanes, encouraging people to use farmers markets and green grocers, and limit council’s own emissions.

Also acknowledging that climate change, and the increased risk of fire/heat/flood/food scarcity etc is a justice and equity issue often impacting the worst those who are most marginalised in the community - so we need to ensure a just transition.

I would be advocating for supporting First Nations people in caring for Country as this is to the benefit of everyone, especially in times of increased climate precarity.  We need to bring everyone along for the changes that are needed.

                  <div class="answer">
                    I need to familiarise myself with this policy. Council would have to find out how it is impacting community and engage in community consultation.

I recognise that we all have a part to play in creating a more ‘just’ world and a livable planet for future generations.

The issues of climate change show us the connection between the local and the global and how the seemingly small actions and advocacy on a local level can be part of bigger change on a global level.  Similarly the global climate crisis is already having a very local effect on residents here - with more floods, fires, extreme heat and food shortages and economic impact. Predicted to get worse in the years to come.

                Yes, I hear you and feel you and all of what community is experiencing. As a First Nations woman who has children in the shire who has been subjected to racism, I believe in calling it out, standing strong and finding more opportunities for truth telling and educating our communities.

Through initiatives where First Nations people and allies/wider community to ‘koling wadangitj’ (walk together) as a collective.  
These could include school based initiatives to promote and support Indigenous education delivery in our local schools, working closely with the KESOs Korrie Education Support Officers, as well as other community initiatives like co-led, co-designed projects such as the Mount Alexander Shire Biodiversity strategy.

More signage, dual language places and interpretations of places and spaces within our shire which focus on First Nations stories and perspectives and then linking or noting the historical story of place with a narrative that does not erase or soften truth telling.

By committing to these seemingly small acts, this will promote and bring more awareness to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander presence in our community, and recognise/acknowledge our first peoples here, Djarra.

The issues of climate change show us the connection between the local and the global and how the seemingly small actions and advocacy on a local level can be part of bigger change on a global level.  Similarly the global climate crisis is already having a very local effect on residents here - with more floods, fires, extreme heat and food shortages and economic impact. Predicted to get worse in the years to come.

                Absolutely because I live it everyday because of my own identified disability having being diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder 7 years ago, and I also have children that have identified disabilities. I can closely relate to the need expressed from this organisation.

I would also encourage and support the cross pollination, collaboration and relationship building between organisations with shared needs and interests - in this case as it relates to housing - whilst acknowledging the ongoing challenges they face.
