        I am a local parent, teacher and artist, grateful to be living here on beautiful Djaara country. I’m also a recent union delegate and passionate advocate for workers’ rights and public education.<br><br>I love our community and our environment. I’m motivated to stand for Council because we need a council that is willing to be bold on the issues that matter most: cost of living, housing, environment and our local community services. The only way we are going to get that action is if there are passionate, progressive councillors representing our community. We face so many challenges. At a national and state level we are being failed by our governments. With run-away housing and cost-of-living increases, growing inequality and insufficient response to the climate crisis, we need our governments to be doing better. At a local level this means meeting the unique needs of the communities of Mount Alexander and building our resilience. Please support and back the candidates who will give us the leadership we need.<br><br>It’s been such a privilege and a pleasure getting to know the Castlemaine community better over the campaign period. Moonlight Creek is an overwhelmingly progressive, switched-on and ambitious ward, with strong connections to our local environment. I look forward to representing you and working with you to make our shire as good as it can be. <br><br>Please follow my campaign at www.facebook.com/lucasmaddockgreens<br>

              <div class="answer">
                Council can and should lead the change we need to address racism in our community. I'm committed to First Nations justice, in which learning and truth telling are vital. Schools and our education institutions must provide culturally safe and appropriate learning environments for all, especially First Nations people. First Nations people are best placed to direct and lead what this looks like. I'm committed to working with First Nations groups to understand the best way to address racism and promote inclusiveness. Where state and Federal institutions fail our community, including in schools, Council should be playing a key role in articulating shortfalls and advocating for solutions.

                Meeting and connecting with the communities of Moonlight Creek has been the most enjoyable part of my campaign. I love talking to people, hearing about their experiences and ideas, and workshopping the issues that matter most to them. I will continue to make myself available through regular, formal and informal listening posts, and will continue to knock on community doors to canvas feedback on the issues that matter most to this community. I also welcome  feedback and input from all constituents and groups at any time by emailing lucas.maddock@vic.greens.org.au.

                As an adult-educator in TAFEs, universities and community organisations, I have worked effectively with very broad cross-sections of our society. I have always recognised and appreciated the differing perspectives in any teaching groups and have been committed to listening to and understanding them. I believe strongly in the power of respectful dialogue and communication to reach consensus, even where there may be significant differences. I look forward to bringing this into the Councillor role.

              <div class="answer">
                A diverse, equitable and healthy community is a resilient community. Council can support diversity by ensuring inclusiveness, most importantly in decision making roles. It can promote equitable outcomes by adjusting its operations in recognition of the differing abilities and privileges of our community members. Council can promote healthy communities by helping to address housing and cost of living stress, providing vital services, and promoting culture and recreation.
