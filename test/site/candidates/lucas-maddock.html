        <p>I am a local parent, teacher and artist, grateful to be living here on beautiful Djaara country. I’m also a recent union delegate and passionate advocate for workers’ rights and public education.</p><p></p><p>I love our community and our environment. I’m motivated to stand for Council because we need a council that is willing to be bold on the issues that matter most: cost of living, housing, environment and our local community services. The only way we are going to get that action is if there are passionate, progressive councillors representing our community. We face so many challenges. At a national and state level we are being failed by our governments. With run-away housing and cost-of-living increases, growing inequality and insufficient response to the climate crisis, we need our governments to be doing better. At a local level this means meeting the unique needs of the communities of Mount Alexander and building our resilience. Please support and back the candidates who will give us the leadership we need.</p><p></p><p>It’s been such a privilege and a pleasure getting to know the Castlemaine community better over the campaign period. Moonlight Creek is an overwhelmingly progressive, switched-on and ambitious ward, with strong connections to our local environment. I look forward to representing you and working with you to make our shire as good as it can be. </p><p></p><p>Please follow my campaign at www.facebook.com/lucasmaddockgreens</p><p></p>

                  <div class="answer">
                    Council can and should lead the change we need to address racism in our community. I'm committed to First Nations justice, in which learning and truth telling are vital. Schools and our education institutions must provide culturally safe and appropriate learning environments for all, especially First Nations people. First Nations people are best placed to direct and lead what this looks like. I'm committed to working with First Nations groups to understand the best way to address racism and promote inclusiveness. Where state and Federal institutions fail our community, including in schools, Council should be playing a key role in articulating shortfalls and advocating for solutions.

                    As an adult-educator in TAFEs, universities and community organisations, I have worked effectively with very broad cross-sections of our society.

I believe strongly in the power of respectful dialogue and communication to reach consensus, even where there may be significant differences. I look forward to bringing this into the Councillor role.

                  <div class="answer">
                    A diverse, equitable and healthy community is a resilient community. Council can support diversity by ensuring inclusiveness, most importantly in decision making roles. It can promote equitable outcomes by adjusting its operations in recognition of the differing abilities and privileges of our community members. Council can promote healthy communities by helping to address housing and cost of living stress, providing vital services, and promoting culture and recreation.

Releasing vacant dwellings is an important step, as is promoting housing diversity in development, advocating for public and social housing and collaborating with housing organisations to build new affordable housing. </p><p></p>

                    Mount Alexander Greens have identified a significant services gap in youth mental health in our shire. I will push to expand youth services and activities and seek for Council to advocate to State and Federal governments to bring more services to our shire. I’m also aware that housing and cost-of-living stress can have a significant negative impact on families. In this situation kids can be significantly affected. I will push to make housing in our shire more affordable, including for young people, and to address cost of living through improving local services and advocating to State and Federal governments for the systemic change we need.

                    Young people are the future of our shire and our community - literally.

I will seek feedback from Bulortj Children and Youth Network and the Youth Advisory Group on any relevant topics.
