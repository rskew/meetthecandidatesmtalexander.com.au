        <em>Formed during the early stages of COVID-19, the Castlemaine Commons collective works responsively and locally hosting events & discussions -  fostering new ways of communication, community connection, sense making, catalysing action and creating collective future visions. 

We are also part of the newly formed First Nations Solidarity Network - Liyanganyuk Banyul. As non-Indigenous community members we understand it is our responsibility to walk together in right relationship with a commitment to truth telling. We know that when First Peoples are supported to thrive, we all thrive.</em>
        <h4>Since the referendum we have seen an increase in racism in schools and across our community. How will you address this division and ensure there is accountability and transparency about the learning and truth telling that is needed? </h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b></b>
        </div>
        I will model non-racist behaviour, call out racism, report racism and ensure the council has strong anti-racism statements, policies and practices. Council needs to be at the forefront of  tackling racism in our shire. I'm committed to justice based on voice, truth telling and treaty for First Nations people.
        <h4>To inform your leadership decisions, will you personally commit to ongoing learning about anti-racism, truth telling and colonisation? </h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        I have undertaken cultural training in the past and recognise its importance. There is still much I need to know and do about racism and colonisation personally; especially in this shire with such a vivid history of colonisation at its worst. I am committed to learning more.
        <h4>Would you support offering and increasing professional development for all Council staff in cultural awareness and anti-racism, and making this a requirement of both Councillors and the Executive team within Council? </h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        Council needs to embed cultural awareness and anti-racism professional development in its training of all staff to ensure a safe workplace. It has a responsibility to provide an inclusive work environments. Council can also model cultural awareness and anti-racist practices in the community.  I would push to make such professional development training a requirement for all staff. It has certainly been important when I have undertaken it in my workplaces.
        <h4>Djaara (Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation) and Nalderun Education Aboriginal Organisation provide an important contribution to this community. Will you commit to strengthening the collaborative relationships and support that has been built between MASC and these organisations as well as with other local First Nations led enterprises and organisations? 
This may be through increasing funding from MASC for programs run by Nalderun Education Aboriginal Organisation, such as the Me-Mandook Bush Tucker Education Place, increasing advocacy and in-kind support, increased partnerships and meaningful relationship building.</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        There is more the council could do in this area although it has made some progress in recent years. I would support council increasing MASC funding and support in ways that are driven by First Nations organisations, particularly Nalderun Education Aboriginal Organisation. I pay my rent.
        <h4>As you are settling into your Council role later this year, the Victorian Treaty process will be entering into an important stage of Statewide Treaty negotiations, with local Traditional Owner Treaties commencing soon after. 
What role do you envision MASC playing in the Treaty process, and how can you support local Treaty negotiations in partnership with local Traditional Owners, Elders and First Nations Leaders? 
Preparing MASC for local Traditional Owner Treaty negotiations may include, for example, development of a discussion paper on how Council can engage with the Treaty Negotiation Framework.</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b></b>
        </div>
        Our council could be a vital partner in the Treaty process but it must always be lead by and learn from traditional owners. If elected I would push to negotiate a discussion paper based on the preferences of local aboriginal leaders and then a council plan for engagement.
        <h4>Will you write to the First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria and the Treaty Authority, the independent body that oversees Treaty-making in Victoria, to express the Shire’s desire to be party to future Traditional Owner Treaties?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Only if it is supported by local First Peoples' leaders</b>
        </div>
        I would push for the shire to express its desire to be a party to the treaties only if this is the preference of local traditional leaders. It is important that the council support traditional leaders in any local treaty making as the shire contains such an important history of colonial violence, invasion and dispossession.

        <h4>How will you maintain strong connections and ensure you keep in touch with your constituents?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b></b>
        </div>
        I would conduct Listening Posts, surveys and consultations. I would join relevant committees, ask questions, reply to correspondence, be available and volunteer to help.
        <h4>How effective are you at collaborating with people who may have different perspectives and values?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b></b>
        </div>
        I believe that all people have a right and a need to have their issues heard and considered. As a experienced social worker and counsellor I have had many years of professional practice in listening to and collaborating with diverse groups of people. 
        <h4>In your view, what contributes to a resilient community, and how can the council support that?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b></b>
        </div>
        A resilient community is one that looks after its most vulnerable members and fosters widespread participation of different kinds from diverse groups and voices.  We are stronger and wiser together. This shire has a great diversity and strength but there are many challenges ahead. Council needs to be humble, engaged and open to considering the needs of residents especially those who find it hard to get seen and heard. It also needs to adddress as a priority the greatest challenges faced at present; cost of living, climate emergency, housing and the environment as well as the particular needs in the Campbells Creel ward.

        <em><a href="https://castlemainepride.org.au/">Castlemaine Pride</a> is a volunteer-led community group that organises the Pride Festival each year. The community grew out of the local grassroots movement in support of marriage equality. They continue to support and connect the local LGBTQIA+ community and advocate for the safety and inclusion of LGBTQIA+ people in the Mount Alexander Shire.</em>
        <h4>Things should be getting better for LGBTQIA+ young people but, alarmingly, in 2024 discrimination and hate speech is on the rise. 66% of LGBTQIA+ youth in Australia still experience discrimination just for being who they are. 

If elected to council, do you commit to engaging with and supporting LGBTQIA+ youth to create a Discrimination Action Plan in our Shire?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        The current MASC Gender Equality Action Plan is a good initiative but taking it further to developing a Discrimination Action Plan is a step I would fully support. The council must do all it can to adress discrimination across the community.
        <h4>A key gap in Australia is the lack of population-level information and service data that adequately reflects trans and gender-diverse people. Ideally the whole Shire should be a safe space for our trans and gender diverse community. 

If elected to council, do you commit to ensure trans and gender diverse people receive equal opportunities, have access to safe spaces, and effective healthcare services? </h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        I would certainly advocate for trans and gender diverse people receiving equal opportunities, and access to safe spaces, and effective healthcare services. Health care services especially mental health services are in short supply for many people in rural Victoria. The council does not provide direct health services but can help provide safe spaces and adopt equal opportunity policies.  I would certainly support these.
        <h4>Not one candidate in the Mt Alexander Shire elected in 2020, fully supported the ‘Rainbow Local Government’ pledge. Some candidates did not even take part in the survey. 
Will you vow to take the ‘Rainbow Pledge’ put forth by The Victorian Pride Lobby, and support the priorities of LGBTQIA+ people within our community?

Information about the Pledge and Survey can be found here: https://rainbowvotes.com.au/ </h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        I have taken the pledge most willingly and am committed to its five actions. I am personally commited to supporting LGBTQIA+ people.

        <em><a href"https://www.castlemainesafespace.org/">Castlemaine Safe Space</a> is a non-clinical drop­ in Space for anyone in emotional distress, or experiencing loneliness or suicidal thoughts. We are community designed and led, and staffed by trained peer volunteers with lived experience.</em>
        <h4>Would you support and advocate for future funding to ensure the sustainability of Castlemaine Safe Space, and if so, how would you do this?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        Castlemaine Safe Space needs to be sustainable and well resourced. As a Social Worker who worked for many years in suicide prevention and response I see the great benefit of such an initiative in preventing suicide and self harm. I support the council providing direct funding and advocating for other funding sources in consultation with the managers of the Safe Space and other advocates.
        <h4>Would you prioritise emergency housing for people experiencing homelessness? If so, how would you do this?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        People experiencing homelessness need to be the highest priority for emergency housing. In this shire and across the state the demand far exceeds the supply in the current housing crisis. I acknowledge the great work of My Home Network, Dhelkaya Health and MASARG to find more emergency housing in the shire. I would push for the council to support these programs, to find innovative sources of emergency housing and to advocate for more resources for emergency housing in the shire.

        <em>School Strike For Climate is a network of school students united by our concern for the future of our planet and all life on it.</em>
        <h4>What role do you think that Council can play in fighting the climate crisis? And what do you think are its limitations?
</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b></b>
        </div>
        The council has recognised the climate emergency. It can can strengthen and fully implement it's climate action plan and support shire-wide and household initiatives to reduce carbon pollution. It can also advise locals and fund local initiatives such as solar for tenants and community batteries. A rural local council cannot make state or federal laws to stop fossil fuels but it needs to do whatever it can locally and advocate that all governments act quickly and significantly. It also needs to plan for a future with climate change impacts within the shire.
        <h4>Would you advocate at a State and Federal level to take stronger climate action if you were elected?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        The climate emergency must be addressed in every possible way at all levels of government. MASC must advocate for action with all levels of government and take stronger action itself. It must also eschew inadequate solutions such as nuclear power and carbon sequestration.
        <h4>Councils have a long history of influencing state and federal government issues, and they are uniquely placed to advocate on behalf of the communities they represent. 

With this in mind, what is your view on the current Council’s decision in early 2024 to adopt a policy which allows Council to abstain from international, national, and state issues, particularly on issues that impact members of our community?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b></b>
        </div>
        I do not support the Council's decision and would want it reversed. The council has a vital role in involving itself in and advocating for the issues that impact the lives of its residents. Councils have proved to be effective advocates for change on vital issues again and again and I fully support this role.

        <h4>Given that MASC declared a climate emergency and the UN peak scientific climate body the IPCC said in March 2023 that there can be no new fossil fuel projects if we are to have even a chance of aligning with Paris, will you support council taking action to change its default super fund for its employees to an ethical fund that has ruled out investing in companies doing new fossil fuel projects?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        Council taking this action would be an important step in helping super funds get out of fossil fuel investments. I have been part of a collective action against one super fund which refused to disinvest in fossil fuels. I would investigate how the council can do this and support a council motion to do it. I also appreciate that workers can select their own fund.

        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b></b>
        </div>
        I would not support any policy when the evidence is clear that it is not effective. I will be guided by the latest research and best evidence-based practices.
        <h4>Mount Alexander Shire Council declared a climate emergency in 2019 with the aim of reaching zero carbon emissions by 2030. 

If you are elected, will you ensure that all of Council's financial transactions and commitments are transparent in regard to climate and First Nations justice, human rights and the environment? If so, how will you do this?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        Transparency in all Council dealing is a vital part of democratic government and a Greens commitment. I would explore which transactions and commitments are currently not transparent and why. I would push for maximum transparency and also for changes to any council practices that are harmful to the climate, First Nations justice, human rights and the environment.

        <h4>If elected as a local Councillor at the October 2024 Local Government Elections, do you commit to support a Council Resolution denouncing Israel’s Occupation, Apartheid, and Genocidal War on Palestine?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        I would support such a resolution denouncing Israel’s Occupation of Palestinian territories, Apartheid, and Genocidal War on Palestine as a small but significant step. Our council should also play a leading role in seeking to resolve important divisions in our community and not ignore them. It should seek to minimize marginalisation of any community groups.
Council can and should take principled stances against apartheid, genocide and human rights abuses - including denouncing Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, while being sensitive to and inclusive of all community members. I will support any practical steps towards this. It is something that can unite our community and maintain and uphold some of the most important principles of a multi-cultural,  peaceful and prosperous society. 

        <h4>If elected as a local Councillor at the October 2024 Local Government Elections, do you commit to ensure the Council adopts an active and consistent position on human rights and demonstrates this by formally committing to Cultural Diversity and Inclusion within the first two years?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        I can see that there is  a good case for an overarching Cultural Diversity and Inclusion policy. I support MASC Pillar 1 - A healthy, connected and inclusive community. The shire community has taken some proactive steps towards inclusion. The council currently has a Reconciliation Plan, a Disability Inclusion Plan, adopted a Refugee Welcome Zone and supports other programs such as youth events which help foster diversity and inclusion. Rural Australians for Refugees Castlemaine and Loddon Campaspe Multicultural Services are also active and deserve council's support.   Any human rights abuses that involve the council I would seek to expose and report.
        <h4>If elected as a local Councillor at the October 2024 Local Government Elections, do you commit to update the Council's procurement and investment policies to avoid and divest from companies that support or profit from internationally recognised human rights abuses, and increase the transparency of Council’s financial transactions and commitments?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        Transparency in all Council dealing is a vital principle and part of democratic government. I would explore which transactions and commitments are currently not transparent and why. I would push for council to adopt such policies, to access the list of companies that support or profit from internationally recognised human rights abuses and use it to divest and to procure elsewhere. Councils should never do business with firms that support human rights abuses.

        <b></b>
        </div>
        Yes, the needs of people with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities is being increasingly understood and recognised. With Federal and State governments both failing repeatedly to provide social and affordable housing council must do all it can with local partners. It must also advocate to state and federal government for adequate social and public housing for people with a disability.

        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b></b>
        </div>
        Yes, this is a big job but very important. I would fully support the MASC Disability Inclusion Action Plan and would want to measure its progress and evaluate its success. After 2027 it would be important to adopt a new plan.

The My Home Network works closely with Mount Alexander Shire Council across various departments and with the permanent full time housing solutions broker Clare Richards.

We support Council in their work to address the housing crisis -see Let's talk about affordable housing | Shape Mount Alexander which is essentially about bringing diverse social housing to Mount Alexander Shire (we need 600 more social housing units) and setting up a Mount Alexander Charitable  Affordable Housing Trust (MAAHT) .

They are also in the process of employing a Homelessness coordinator who will scope, support and coordinate formal and informal Homelessness supports in the Shire.</em>
        <h4>If elected, would you join the My Home Network (MHN) and support our work?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        In the current housing crisis MHN does a great job and needs further Council support and funding. I would be happy to join. I should have already.
        <h4>Would you support the improved integration of housing across different departments within Council?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>I don't really understand this question. </b>
        </div>
        I 'm not clear what 'integration of housing' means within a shire council. I would support any practical measure to further the interests of housing in the shire.
        <h4>Would you support MHN’s advocacy to Council to improve the Tiny Homes On Wheels (THOW) local law in having nationally approved onsite waste management systems as an option (currently waste management has to be off site) and allowing a financial exchange between the THOW owner or occupier and land owner?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        I believe that more and tenanting THOW would be a clear step forward in a housing crisis. I would support making this more possible while ensuring environmental and safety measures are met. 
        <h4>Would you support MHN’s advocacy to Council to engage with the Shire’s residents to encourage the release of the over 1000 vacant dwellings (this doesn’t include primary and secondary Air BnBs) in our Shire as affordable rentals or transition housing?</h3>
        <div style="padding: 5px;">
        <b>Yes</b>
        </div>
        Vacant dwellings are a vital source of additional accommodation in a housing crisis that is severely impacting many locals, particularly young families and less well off residents. I understand that MHN is doing this work well and has had some limited success.   I would push for the council to explore how its policies and practices could discourage vacancies. I would also support council advocacy and resourcing to encourage absent homeowners to release more properties.

        </div>
        The Greens support and celebrate our culturally diverse society and support our humanitarian responsibility in offering refuge and dignity to people fleeing persecution.

I would support the council consulting with Rural Australians for Refugees Castlemaine and Loddon Campaspe Multicultural Services to develop a new action plan and have the Council promote it. I would push for the council to host and participate in welcoming and inclusive events and strategies.

        <em>Billy Lister - Young Citizen of the Year 2022, representative of Mount Alexander Shire Youth Advisory Group and Castlemaine Secondary College Student representative council canvassed young people in the Mount Alexander Shire to present a series of questions for the candidates in the Mount Alexander Shire local council election.</em>
        <h4>The 2023-2026 Mount Alexander Shire Middle Years Plan was adopted last year, how would you ensure that those recommendations are implemented and delivered efficiently?</h3>

        I would push for the council supporting and resourcing the Steering group, and providing the funds as agreed and offering any expertise or assistance that would help ensure the success of the plan. I would support an evaluation and for the learnings and recommendations at the end of the Plan to come to the council. I would then support the development of a new Plan past 2026.
        <h4>Young people across the world, country and shire are facing profound challenges when it comes to mental health and wellbeing. Council's Pillar of - a healthy, connected and inclusive community - strongly aligns with this issue. How will you ensure that this Pillar can promote the future and mental health of young people's mental health in the shire? </h3>

        The Pillar is a good statement of principle or intent.  The context, long recognised by mental health advocates and the local Greens branch, is a critical shortage of mental health services nationally for all people and for rural young people in particular. The council can play an important role in advocating for better mental health services for young people in the shire. I would support the council to play an important role in assisting the Bulortj Children and Youth Network, and providing arts, sports, leisure and recreational opportunities that are safe, diverse, inclusive and welcoming of young people. I would also want the council to advocate strongly for better funding for our state schools and for the essential student wellbeing programs needed in each school.  
        <h4>Council's Pillar of - a resilient and growing local economy - also includes a community that is inclusive and connected (2021-2025 council plan). How will you as a councillor listen to the voices of young people and ensure they are connected to council and their community? </h3>

        I recognise that this shire will only thrive if young people thrive in the shire. If I become a councillor I will establish a regular schedule of listening posts with young people at the places where they meet, especially in my Campbells Creek ward. I would also promote the range of opportunities for young people to connect with the community and the council's services. I would also investigate how the council can provide education for young people about the council's role and operations and ways to connect.
