        <p>I am a Mount Alexander local of 27 years and a long term social activist with 45 years experience in progressive and community advocacy. As a senior social worker I have campaigned for suicide prevention, mental health promotion and services for young people. These experiences have shown me the importance of public services in supporting our community and the power of collective action in creating change. It is time for me to make a personal committment to changing the council to a progressive one and offering Campbells Creek voters a real alternative as a Greens candidate.</p><p></p><p>The Campbells Creek community is unique and  residents want action on the climate crisis and to make a more equal and just society. So many people in our community are struggling with the cost of living and housing crises. We need a progressive council to act on the big issues that weâ€™re facing and reflect the progressive values of this community. </p><p></p><p>As your Greens councillor, I would fight for Campbells Creek by: [1] supporting affordable housing and opposing poor planning impacting residents; [2] expanding essential services that will assist with cost-of-living pressures, such as child, aged and youth services and libraries; [3] reducing power bills and taking climate action through solar rollout, community batteries and going electric; [4] supporting bike trails and public transport; and [5] protecting our beautiful heritage and environment while supporting wildlife and biodiversity along our creek. </p>

                    A resilient community is one that looks after its most vulnerable members and fosters widespread participation of different kinds from diverse groups and voices.  We are stronger and wiser together. This shire has a great diversity and strength but there are many challenges ahead. Council needs to be humble, engaged and open to considering the needs of residents especially those who find it hard to get seen and heard. It also needs to adddress as a priority the greatest challenges faced at present; cost of living, climate emergency, housing and the environment as well as the particular needs in the Campbells Creel ward.

                    The council has recognised the climate emergency. It can can strengthen and fully implement it's climate action plan and support shire-wide and household initiatives to reduce carbon pollution.

A rural local council cannot make state or federal laws to stop fossil fuels but it needs to do whatever it can locally and advocate that all governments act quickly and significantly.

                  <div class="answer">
                    The Pillar is a good statement of principle or intent.  The context, long recognised by mental health advocates and the local Greens branch, is a critical shortage of mental health services nationally for all people and for rural young people in particular. The council can play an important role in advocating for better mental health services for young people in the shire. I would support the council to play an important role in assisting the Bulortj Children and Youth Network, and providing arts, sports, leisure and recreational opportunities that are safe, diverse, inclusive and welcoming of young people. I would also want the council to advocate strongly for better funding for our state schools and for the essential student wellbeing programs needed in each school.

                  <div class="answer">
                    I recognise that this shire will only thrive if young people thrive in the shire. If I become a councillor I will establish a regular schedule of listening posts with young people at the places where they meet, especially in my Campbells Creek ward. I would also promote the range of opportunities for young people to connect with the community and the council's services. I would also investigate how the council can provide education for young people about the council's role and operations and ways to connect.
