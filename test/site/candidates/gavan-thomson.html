      <div id="about">
        I am a Mount Alexander local of 27 years and a long term social activist with 45 years experience in progressive and community advocacy. As a senior social worker I have campaigned for suicide prevention, mental health promotion and services for young people. These experiences have shown me the importance of public services in supporting our community and the power of collective action in creating change. It is time for me to make a personal committment to changing the council to a progressive one and offering Campbells Creek voters a real alternative as a Greens candidate.

The Campbells Creek community is unique and  residents want action on the climate crisis and to make a more equal and just society. So many people in our community are struggling with the cost of living and housing crises. We need a progressive council to act on the big issues that we’re facing and reflect the progressive values of this community. 

As your Greens councillor, I would fight for Campbells Creek by: [1] supporting affordable housing and opposing poor planning impacting residents; [2] expanding essential services that will assist with cost-of-living pressures, such as child, aged and youth services and libraries; [3] reducing power bills and taking climate action through solar rollout, community batteries and going electric; [4] supporting bike trails and public transport; and [5] protecting our beautiful heritage and environment while supporting wildlife and biodiversity along our creek.

              I have undertaken cultural training in the past and recognise its importance. There is still much I need to know and do about racism and colonisation personally; especially in this shire with such a vivid history of colonisation at its worst. I am committed to learning more.

              Council needs to embed cultural awareness and anti-racism professional development in its training of all staff to ensure a safe workplace. It has a responsibility to provide an inclusive work environments. Council can also model cultural awareness and anti-racist practices in the community.  I would push to make such professional development training a requirement for all staff. It has certainly been important when I have undertaken it in my workplaces.

              I would push for the shire to express its desire to be a party to the treaties only if this is the preference of local traditional leaders. It is important that the council support traditional leaders in any local treaty making as the shire contains such an important history of colonial violence, invasion and dispossession.

              A resilient community is one that looks after its most vulnerable members and fosters widespread participation of different kinds from diverse groups and voices.  We are stronger and wiser together. This shire has a great diversity and strength but there are many challenges ahead. Council needs to be humble, engaged and open to considering the needs of residents especially those who find it hard to get seen and heard. It also needs to adddress as a priority the greatest challenges faced at present; cost of living, climate emergency, housing and the environment as well as the particular needs in the Campbells Creel ward.

              The council has recognised the climate emergency. It can can strengthen and fully implement it's climate action plan and support shire-wide and household initiatives to reduce carbon pollution. It can also advise locals and fund local initiatives such as solar for tenants and community batteries. A rural local council cannot make state or federal laws to stop fossil fuels but it needs to do whatever it can locally and advocate that all governments act quickly and significantly. It also needs to plan for a future with climate change impacts within the shire.

Council can and should take principled stances against apartheid, genocide and human rights abuses - including denouncing Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, while being sensitive to and inclusive of all community members. I will support any practical steps towards this. It is something that can unite our community and maintain and uphold some of the most important principles of a multi-cultural,  peaceful and prosperous society.

            <div class="answer">
              I can see that there is  a good case for an overarching Cultural Diversity and Inclusion policy. I support MASC Pillar 1 - A healthy, connected and inclusive community. The shire community has taken some proactive steps towards inclusion. The council currently has a Reconciliation Plan, a Disability Inclusion Plan, adopted a Refugee Welcome Zone and supports other programs such as youth events which help foster diversity and inclusion. Rural Australians for Refugees Castlemaine and Loddon Campaspe Multicultural Services are also active and deserve council's support.   Any human rights abuses that involve the council I would seek to expose and report.

            <div class="answer">
              Transparency in all Council dealing is a vital principle and part of democratic government. I would explore which transactions and commitments are currently not transparent and why. I would push for council to adopt such policies, to access the list of companies that support or profit from internationally recognised human rights abuses and use it to divest and to procure elsewhere. Councils should never do business with firms that support human rights abuses.

              Yes, the needs of people with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities is being increasingly understood and recognised. With Federal and State governments both failing repeatedly to provide social and affordable housing council must do all it can with local partners. It must also advocate to state and federal government for adequate social and public housing for people with a disability.

The My Home Network works closely with Mount Alexander Shire Council across various departments and with the permanent full time housing solutions broker Clare Richards.

We support Council in their work to address the housing crisis -see Let's talk about affordable housing | Shape Mount Alexander which is essentially about bringing diverse social housing to Mount Alexander Shire (we need 600 more social housing units) and setting up a Mount Alexander Charitable  Affordable Housing Trust (MAAHT) .

              Vacant dwellings are a vital source of additional accommodation in a housing crisis that is severely impacting many locals, particularly young families and less well off residents. I understand that MHN is doing this work well and has had some limited success.   I would push for the council to explore how its policies and practices could discourage vacancies. I would also support council advocacy and resourcing to encourage absent homeowners to release more properties.

              The Pillar is a good statement of principle or intent.

The council can play an important role in advocating for better mental health services for young people in the shire. I would support the council to play an important role in assisting the Bulortj Children and Youth Network, and providing arts, sports, leisure and recreational opportunities that are safe, diverse, inclusive and welcoming of young people.
