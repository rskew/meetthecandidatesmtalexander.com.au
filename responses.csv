We are stronger and wiser together. This shire has a great diversity and strength but there are many challenges ahead. Council needs to be humble, engaged and open to considering the needs of residents especially those who find it hard to get seen and heard.

I would certainly support these.",I have taken the pledge most willingly and am committed to its five actions. I am personally commited to supporting LGBTQIA+ people.,Yes,Castlemaine Safe Space needs to be sustainable and well resourced.

I support the council providing direct funding and advocating for other funding sources in consultation with the managers of the Safe Space and other advocates.,Yes,"People experiencing homelessness need to be the highest priority for emergency housing. In this shire and across the state the demand far exceeds the supply in the current housing crisis. I acknowledge the great work of My Home Network, Dhelkaya Health and MASARG to find more emergency housing in the shire. I would push for the council to support these programs, to find innovative sources of emergency housing and to advocate for more resources for emergency housing in the shire.",The council has recognised the climate emergency. It can can strengthen and fully implement it's climate action plan and support shire-wide and household initiatives to reduce carbon pollution. It can also advise locals and fund local initiatives such as solar for tenants and community batteries. A rural local council cannot make state or federal laws to stop fossil fuels but it needs to do whatever it can locally and advocate that all governments act quickly and significantly. It also needs to plan for a future with climate change impacts within the shire.,Yes,The climate emergency must be addressed in every possible way at all levels of government. MASC must advocate for action with all levels of government and take stronger action itself. It must also eschew inadequate solutions such as nuclear power and carbon sequestration.,I do not support the Council's decision and would want it reversed. The council has a vital role in involving itself in and advocating for the issues that impact the lives of its residents. Councils have proved to be effective advocates for change on vital issues again and again and I fully support this role.,Council taking this action would be an important step in helping super funds get out of fossil fuel investments. I have been part of a collective action against one super fund which refused to disinvest in fossil fuels. I would investigate how the council can do this and support a council motion to do it. I also appreciate that workers can select their own fund.,"Transparency in all Council dealing is a vital part of democratic government and a Greens commitment. I would explore which transactions and commitments are currently not transparent and why. I would push for maximum transparency and also for changes to any council practices that are harmful to the climate, First Nations justice, human rights and the environment. ",Yes,"I would support such a resolution denouncing Israel’s Occupation of Palestinian territories, Apartheid, and Genocidal War on Palestine as a small but significant step. Our council should also play a leading role in seeking to resolve important divisions in our community and not ignore them. It should seek to minimize marginalisation of any community groups.
Council can and should take principled stances against apartheid, genocide and human rights abuses - including denouncing Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, while being sensitive to and inclusive of all community members. I will support any practical steps towards this. It is something that can unite our community and maintain and uphold some of the most important principles of a multi-cultural,  peaceful and prosperous society. 
",Yes,"I can see that there is  a good case for an overarching Cultural Diversity and Inclusion policy. I support MASC Pillar 1 - A healthy, connected and inclusive community. The shire community has taken some proactive steps towards inclusion. The council currently has a Reconciliation Plan, a Disability Inclusion Plan, adopted a Refugee Welcome Zone and supports other programs such as youth events which help foster diversity and inclusion. Rural Australians for Refugees Castlemaine and Loddon Campaspe Multicultural Services are also active and deserve council's support.   Any human rights abuses that involve the council I would seek to expose and report.",Yes,"Transparency in all Council dealing is a vital principle and part of democratic government. I would explore which transactions and commitments are currently not transparent and why. I would push for council to adopt such policies, to access the list of companies that support or profit from internationally recognised human rights abuses and use it to divest and to procure elsewhere. Councils should never do business with firms that support human rights abuses.","Yes, the needs of people with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities is being increasingly understood and recognised. With Federal and State governments both failing repeatedly to provide social and affordable housing council must do all it can with local partners. It must also advocate to state and federal government for adequate social and public housing for people with a disability. ","Yes, this is a big job but very important. I would fully support the MASC Disability Inclusion Action Plan and would want to measure its progress and evaluate its success. After 2027 it would be important to adopt a new plan.",Yes,In the current housing crisis MHN does a great job and needs further Council support and funding. I would be happy to join. I should have already.,I don't really understand this question. ,I 'm not clear what 'integration of housing' means within a shire council. I would support any practical measure to further the interests of housing in the shire.,Yes,I believe that more and tenanting THOW would be a clear step forward in a housing crisis. I would support making this more possible while ensuring environmental and safety measures are met. ,Yes,"Vacant dwellings are a vital source of additional accommodation in a housing crisis that is severely impacting many locals, particularly young families and less well off residents. I understand that MHN is doing this work well and has had some limited success.   I would push for the council to explore how its policies and practices could discourage vacancies. I would also support council advocacy and resourcing to encourage absent homeowners to release more properties.",Yes,"The Greens support and celebrate our culturally diverse society and support our humanitarian responsibility in offering refuge and dignity to people fleeing persecution. With the action plan now 3 years out of date it is clearly in need of a review, renegotiation and re-adoption. I would push for re-stating the shire's commitment and for a new action plan.","I support MASC's Pillar 1 - A healthy, connected and inclusive community.   I would support the council consulting with Rural Australians for Refugees Castlemaine and Loddon Campaspe Multicultural Services to develop a new action plan and have the Council promote it. I would push for the council to host and participate in welcoming and inclusive events and strategies.","I am a Mount Alexander local of 27 years and a long term social activist with 45 years experience in progressive and community advocacy. As a senior social worker I have campaigned for suicide prevention, mental health promotion and services for young people. These experiences have shown me the importance of public services in supporting our community and the power of collective action in creating change. It is time for me to make a personal committment to changing the council to a progressive one and offering Campbells Creek voters a real alternative as a Greens candidate.

The Campbells Creek community is unique and  residents want action on the climate crisis and to make a more equal and just society. So many people in our community are struggling with the cost of living and housing crises. We need a progressive council to act on the big issues that we’re facing and reflect the progressive values of this community. 

As your Greens councillor, I would fight for Campbells Creek by: [1] supporting affordable housing and opposing poor planning impacting residents; [2] expanding essential services that will assist with cost-of-living pressures, such as child, aged and youth services and libraries; [3] reducing power bills and taking climate action through solar rollout, community batteries and going electric; [4] supporting bike trails and public transport; and [5] protecting our beautiful heritage and environment while supporting wildlife and biodiversity along our creek. ","I will model non-racist behaviour, call out racism, report racism and ensure the council has strong anti-racism statements, policies and practices. Council needs to be at the forefront of  tackling racism in our shire. I'm committed to justice based on voice, truth telling and treaty for First Nations people.",Yes,Yes,The current MASC Gender Equality Action Plan is a good initiative but taking it further to developing a Discrimination Action Plan is a step I would fully support. The council must do all it can to adress discrimination across the community.,Yes,Our council could be a vital partner in the Treaty process but it must always be lead by and learn from traditional owners. If elected I would push to negotiate a discussion paper based on the preferences of local aboriginal leaders and then a council plan for engagement.,"There is more the council could do in this area although it has made some progress in recent years. I would support council increasing MASC funding and support in ways that are driven by First Nations organisations, particularly Nalderun Education Aboriginal Organisation. I pay my rent.",Only if it is supported by local First Peoples' leaders,"I would push for the council supporting and resourcing the Steering group, and providing the funds as agreed and offering any expertise or assistance that would help ensure the success of the plan. I would support an evaluation and for the learnings and recommendations at the end of the Plan to come to the council. I would then support the development of a new Plan past 2026.","The Pillar is a good statement of principle or intent.  The context, long recognised by mental health advocates and the local Greens branch, is a critical shortage of mental health services nationally for all people and for rural young people in particular. The council can play an important role in advocating for better mental health services for young people in the shire. I would support the council to play an important role in assisting the Bulortj Children and Youth Network, and providing arts, sports, leisure and recreational opportunities that are safe, diverse, inclusive and welcoming of young people. I would also want the council to advocate strongly for better funding for our state schools and for the essential student wellbeing programs needed in each school.  ","I recognise that this shire will only thrive if young people thrive in the shire. If I become a councillor I will establish a regular schedule of listening posts with young people at the places where they meet, especially in my Campbells Creek ward. I would also promote the range of opportunities for young people to connect with the community and the council's services. I would also investigate how the council can provide education for young people about the council's role and operations and ways to connect.",I have undertaken cultural training in the past and recognise its importance. There is still much I need to know and do about racism and colonisation personally; especially in this shire with such a vivid history of colonisation at its worst. I am committed to learning more.,Council needs to embed cultural awareness and anti-racism professional development in its training of all staff to ensure a safe workplace. It has a responsibility to provide an inclusive work environments. Council can also model cultural awareness and anti-racist practices in the community.  I would push to make such professional development training a requirement for all staff. It has certainly been important when I have undertaken it in my workplaces.,"I would push for the shire to express its desire to be a party to the treaties only if this is the preference of local traditional leaders. It is important that the council support traditional leaders in any local treaty making as the shire contains such an important history of colonial violence, invasion and dispossession.",,
9/29/2024 10:18:40,,Yes,"I will support any practical endeavour to improve how we manage our land - especially when this can improve safety and biodiversity outcomes for our shire. We should be constantly reviewing our practices against current data and evidence and updating our practices accordingly.

","As an adult-educator in TAFEs, universities and community organisations, I have worked effectively with very broad cross-sections of our society. I have always recognised and appreciated the differing perspectives in any teaching groups and have been committed to listening to and understanding them. I believe strongly in the power of respectful dialogue and communication to reach consensus, even where there may be significant differences. I look forward to bringing this into the Councillor role.","A diverse, equitable and healthy community is a resilient community. Council can support diversity by ensuring inclusiveness, most importantly in decision making roles. It can promote equitable outcomes by adjusting its operations in recognition of the differing abilities and privileges of our community members. Council can promote healthy communities by helping to address housing and cost of living stress, providing vital services, and promoting culture and recreation. ",,"I am committed to achieving equality for every person in the LGBTIQA+ community. I’m committed to working towards an inclusive and equitable society. Everyone has the right to safe spaces, and effective healthcare services and equal outcomes.

I would take the lead from Castlemaine Safe Space and community advocates and support any reasonable measure to ensure its sustainability. ,Yes,I would take the lead of experts such as My Home Network on this. It is clear our community needs strong action to address this issue and I would support any practical measure which would help people experiencing homelessness. ,"It is very important that Council do everything it can to minimise its environmental impacts. It also can and should play an important role in modelling and advocating for broader positive change across the community. We can reduce carbon emissions, we can promote carbon capturing ecosystems, we can reach better waste and recycling outcomes, we can build better homes and more sustainable homes and communities. Council should be front and centre in all these.",Yes,Councils are the closest tier of government to communities. For this reason they are best-placed to understand the needs and opinions of their community and play an incredibly important role in representing the interests of their community and advocating for positive change.,"Where councils can have a positive impact on national and international issues, and there is significant community backing for it to do so, it is important that they do.",I will support any practical measure that brings us in line with our commitments to the environment and to mitigate the effects of climate change. This includes measures such as changing Council employees’ default super fund. ,"As a member of the Greens I am committed to transparency and accountability in government. This is especially important around issues of climate and First Nations justice, human rights and the environment. I will push for any practical measure to uphold these principles and and will take the lead from organisations and community members as to any practical ways these could be achieved.
",Yes,"Where there are significant divisions in our community, Council can and should be leading the necessary advocacy to heal our communities' fractures. Silence on important issues is not helpful and can deepen rifts and the marginalisation of community members and groups.

Council can and should take principled stances against apartheid, genocide and human rights abuses - including denouncing Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, while being sensitive to and inclusive of all community members. I will support any practical action in this regard. 
",Yes,"Upholding human rights, particularly Cultural Diversity and Inclusion is of paramount importance - especially as we work towards an equitable society. 

I will commit to any practical measure which will promote and work towards cultural diversity and inclusion. Where there are systemic barriers to this or acute needs, I will take the lead from community groups and constituents to ensure issues are being addressed.
",Yes,Council should not be doing business with companies that profit from human rights abuses. I will support updating the Council's procurement and investment policies wherever practical and effective.,"Yes, absolutely. State and Federal Governments are failing Vicorians on public and social housing, including those for people with disabilities.

I will also be pushing for council-initiated affordable housing projects which cater for specific needs of the community, including people with disabilities.

I look forward to working with them and supporting their important initiatives.
",,"I would support any practical measure to improve the delivery of housing and council's administration of housing solutions.
",Yes,"This presents a significant solution for some of our community members most affected by our housing affordability crisis. It should be supported and expanded in any practical way, while mitigating environmental and safety impacts.
",Yes,"The lack of affordable housing in our shire is pushing young people and essential workers out of our shire. This is having negative impacts on families and our essential services, which are struggling to find workers. Council needs to be doing everything it can to make housing more affordable. Releasing vacant dwellings is an important step, as is promoting housing diversity in development, advocating for public and social housing and collaborating with housing organisations to build new affordable housing. 
",Yes,"The Australian Greens believe that Australia's cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity should be celebrated for greatly enriching our society and economy and that refugees be treated with dignity. Local governments are best placed to ensure welcoming, safe and inclusive interactions with services and local government functions.
As this document has lapsed, the Council should, as a priority, review this plan and restate its commitments. This would ensure the good work already done in this area is carried forward.
","I will push for Council to review its progress towards the previously committed Action Plan, and consult with local advocacy groups to work out the best way for Council to welcome refugees and promote inclusiveness and acceptance of cultural diversity in the shire.
","I am a local parent, teacher and artist, grateful to be living here on beautiful Djaara country. I’m also a recent union delegate and passionate advocate for workers’ rights and public education.

I love our community and our environment. I’m motivated to stand for Council because we need a council that is willing to be bold on the issues that matter most: cost of living, housing, environment and our local community services. The only way we are going to get that action is if there are passionate, progressive councillors representing our community. We face so many challenges. At a national and state level we are being failed by our governments. With run-away housing and cost-of-living increases, growing inequality and insufficient response to the climate crisis, we need our governments to be doing better. At a local level this means meeting the unique needs of the communities of Mount Alexander and building our resilience. Please support and back the candidates who will give us the leadership we need.

It’s been such a privilege and a pleasure getting to know the Castlemaine community better over the campaign period. Moonlight Creek is an overwhelmingly progressive, switched-on and ambitious ward, with strong connections to our local environment. I look forward to representing you and working with you to make our shire as good as it can be.

","Council can and should lead the change we need to address racism in our community. I'm committed to First Nations justice, in which learning and truth telling are vital. Schools and our education institutions must provide culturally safe and appropriate learning environments for all, especially First Nations people. First Nations people are best placed to direct and lead what this looks like. I'm committed to working with First Nations groups to understand the best way to address racism and promote inclusiveness. Where state and Federal institutions fail our community, including in schools, Council should be playing a key role in articulating shortfalls and advocating for solutions.
",Yes,Yes,Our council should be doing everything it can to work towards a discrimination-free shire. I will support any practical measure to work towards this. ,Yes,"I will always take the lead from traditional Owners, Elders and First Nations Leaders as to the best way to advance the Victorian Treaty process. I will support any practical measure which will advance this process and support First Nations Justice. ",These relationships are vital and Council should always be working towards strengthening them.,Yes,I will liaise and seek feedback from middle years children and families and Council executives to ascertain Council’s progress towards the middle years priority areas. ,"Mount Alexander Greens have identified a significant services gap in youth mental health in our shire. I will push to expand youth services and activities and seek for Council to advocate to State and Federal governments to bring more services to our shire. I’m also aware that housing and cost-of-living stress can have a significant negative impact on families. In this situation kids can be significantly affected. I will push to make housing in our shire more affordable, including for young people, and to address cost of living through improving local services and advocating to State and Federal governments for the systemic change we need. 
","Young people are the future of our shire and our community - literally. This should be front of mind in all Council’s decision making especially around things like climate change, housing and cost of living, as they are the ones who will be most affected. I will seek feedback from Bulortj Children and Youth Network and the Youth Advisory Group on any relevant topics. I also welcome  feedback and input from young constituents, families and representatives, who can reach me any time by emailing lucas.maddock@vic.greens.org.au. ","I will enthusiastically support any ongoing learning about anti-racism, truth telling and colonisation. ","Council has a responsibility to provide safe and inclusive work environments. They also have a responsibility to model good leadership to our broader community. Cultural awareness training is key to understanding the often unconscious privileges, prejudices, unconscious biases, which is vital for a racism-free workplace. ",I will support any practical initiative from First Nations groups which will promote and further efforts towards Traditional Owner Treaties. I will work with Council and Councillors towards supporting Traditional Owner Treaties and advocating to First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria and the Treaty Authority as such.,,
9/29/2024 20:10:19,,Yes,"I believe our country, indeed our state is frighteningly exposed to the impacts of climate change, particularly fire. We have had a fire on our own property and it wasn't even a hot day. We had over a dozen fire trucks and two helicopters. It was scary. I never want to witness that again. Our state forests and the creatures living within them, are one of the most appealing assets of our shire and must be protected at all costs of a matter of priority. As a keen researcher Id like to fully investigate the best ways of doing this and would welcome further discussion with groups such as FOBIF. Effective fire mitigation its of utmost importance and priority. ",Yes,,Yes,"I think this is an important issue and I would welcome the opportunity to spend appropriate time with you to fully understand all the aspects of what is required. Once this is understood, of course I would do what I can to assist.","As an individual, yes. As a councillor, I would welcome the opportunity to better understand this. It seems a straight forward issue council can support.",,,,,,,,,sustainableMountAlexander@gmail.com,Kerrie Allen,Calder,,"Aside from holding regular listening posts, and attending as many community events as possible, I would like to run regular surveys of my constituents to gauge how they are feeling and what they would like from me. ","I believe in ""seeking first to understand, then to be understood"". In my view it's important to find some sort of common ground  - however small and seemingly insignificant - to build on. ","I think groups such as those involved in this questionnaire are critical in building and maintaining resilience. We must all be positive and forward thinking. Council can take the lead with that. I think it's important that council understand all angles and implications of a situation whether real or perceived, and communicates proactively across the community. It's important that everyone in community feels heard, understood, valued and supported. ",,,,Yes,I believe there may be efficiencies in current council expenditure which we could re-direct to such initiatives. ,Yes,I would work with you and other shires to discuss the quickest safest ways to do this. It may be that short term solutions could be adopted while longer term solutions can be devised. ,"I am inspired by your group and totally supportive of your cause. I believe council can directly impact what occurs in its ""own backyard"" and can strongly advocate for climate more widely. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with you, however a few of my initial thoughts are that we could at a local level:

1. hold more ""earth day"" events for awareness
2. encourage ""lights off"" initiatives to reduce traditional power consumption 
3. support local solar initiatives on rooftops of commercial buildings and covered carparks
4. install ""water for wildlife"" stations and misting systems in our green spaces and work with Parks Victoria to do same in our forests
5. introduce incentives for landowners/residents to plant more native habitat and provide water and shade for critters
6. investigate the operations of our large industries to see how we could assist them to be more climate friendly
7. implement underground water storage to capture heavy rainfall / flood waters, which could then be utilised in times of drought (this is being done successfully elsewhere)





",Yes,,"I need to look into this further. I agree that council can advocate for community, and influence issues at state and federal levels. This is important because often state and federal MPs do not have the time or resources to do so. The role of council is critical in this regard.",I think council should review all its suppliers to ensure climate friendly ones are being sourced from.,I believe this should at least have its own section in the council's annual report. I would advocate for this as well as more regular reporting back to community by way of newsletters.,I believe we need to do all things possible to end the fighting.,I believe the role of council is to support the community and to advocate on such issues. We need to do all things possible to promote peace and an immediate end to the violence. ,Yes,"There are formal one day courses run by universities to cater to such things, however id also be keen to investigate ways to upskill council staff which do not involve high cost outlays. Im interested in working with you on this.",Yes,I believe there may be cost efficiencies to be gained by reviewing current procurement systems. At the same time we can ensure we are not supporting unethical suppliers. This should be reviewed as soon as possible in my view.,"Yes I acknowledge this and if elected, will advocate to ensure it is factored into decisions.",yes,Yes,,Yes,,I would like to better understand all parts of this before committing.,,Yes,"I think we need to ensure that with an increasing population, there is infrastructure to support additional lived-in dwellings. By this I mean footpaths, medical facilities etc.",Yes,,"I think there is a win - win possible because of the fact some of our businesses (cafes, orchards..) are struggling for workers. We could welcome refugees by providing them with work. Their stories should feature in local newspapers and council newsletters amongst progress of other core issues important to community.","I believe our shire is blessed with many unique assets which make it an outstanding place to live, work and visit. I am passionate about protecting the cultural and heritage values, the ""village"" feel, sense of community, and the native flora and fauna which few shires are lucky enough to still have. We must carefully balance growth and development, with the impact to these assets, to ensure we don't lose the very things which make this shire special. 

I have enjoyed decades of senior leadership positions in the corporate world until stopping two years ago to focus on being owner builder (ones choice of superlatives to be inserted here - let's just say I understand what its like to navigate council amongst other things!). I would like to use my skillsets to help promote and protect our shire. In looking at the eight wards, I was struck that the Calder ward is the one which may have the biggest impact socially, economically and environmentally on our shire as a whole in coming years. Harcourt is forecast to see phenomenal growth - the second highest behind Castlemaine in the region. This is both exciting, and scary. We need to get it right.

Im a keen researcher of solutions which are working elsewhere. Wildlife corridors and crossings, sustainable development and environmentally friendly housing, ecotourism ventures which place protection of our natural assets at the forefront of everyone's thinking.... these are some ideas I would welcome the opportunity to table.

The world is in a troubling place in many ways. I am inspired by our local groups who are passionate about doing what they can to steer things in a positive direction, and am committed to doing what I can to assist.","if elected, I commit to working with you to continue to identify and implement ways to effectively address this. The issue should be a regular agenda item on all council meetings.",Yes,Yes,I would welcome the opportunity to work with you in devising this.,"Yes, although in terms of funding, I believe there may be ways to look at efficiencies within council, so ratepayers are not borne with additional costs. ","I would welcome the opportunity to work closely with local groups to ensure we get this plan right. We need not necessarily wait until November when the council election results are communicated. I would welcome local groups reaching out to me sooner, to ensure we are ready whether I am elected or not.",,"I can write at any time as an individual. If as member of council, this would need to wait until council is formed and a vote is taken to do it.",Make it an agenda item at meetings with a clear action item against it for completion.,"I believe the health of our environment plays a big part in the mental health of everyone, including young people. We need to ensure our green spaces are healthy and plentiful. Medical professionals now know that nature is good for mental health and wellbeing. Council should foster more of an awareness and appreciation of the natural flora and fauna we are lucky enough to have in the shire. 

I would also like to see council support more youth groups such as boy-scouts and girl-guides including around Harcourt where I dont believe there are such groups currently and the area is ear-marked for significant population growth.",I would like to run listening posts with young people - perhaps in schools where they can drop in confidentially and chat about anything concerning them. I also think we could involve young people in brainstorming solutions to problems - for example how could we devise wildlife-friendly fencing on sheep properties? What could we do about all the uncovered mines in the area? Young people often have fantastic ideas which we could benefit from. And to be included in devising new solutions I think would boost their feelings of self-worth - and rightly so.,"I am connected to Uncle Gary Murray and have a strong interest in protecting Country across Victoria, but especially in central Victoria. There is indigenous culture in Calder Ward for example which requires stronger protection and promotion. I would welcome the opportunity to work with local groups in upscaling my learning, as part of my wider advocacy.",,,,
9/30/2024 9:58:49,,Yes,"Thank you for your question which raises issues of western science and First Nations knowledge and skills on cool fire burning. I will commit to investigating this matter further to deepen understanding of best practices, where it is occurring within the Shire, and how Council can engage with FFM on this matter, and I will transparently report back the findings.",Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,,,colibanphil@gmail.com,Phillip Walker,Coliban,,"First of all, respect to CCH and all the good work that you do, and the excellent questions that have been submitted. The community house network delivers excellence service and are real active hubs of community connection. There is also a great community house in Maldon, and it would be brilliant if council could nurture the rise of similar hubs in other towns across the Shire.
There are concepts such as deliberative democracy, participatory democracy, and democratic governance and methodologies that flow from them. I am skilled in the application of many of these methodologies, such as Assets Based Community Development. At operational level within Council, I know that staff use many strength-based tools are applied. 
These principles can also apply at governance level. I consider it essential that councillors retain active contact with the broad community, informing them of issues and canvassing viewpoints and opinions. This needs to be done openly and transparently. One method is to regularly hold Constituent Assemblies, perhaps once or twice a year. This Forum is an example. More so perhaps is to be in regular engagement with the representatives of the organisations that held this Forum and other community organisations in their area of interest. Holding regular ‘listening’ posts and being available to the constituency is a standard and effective mechanism. Regular communication through local media is another, although I have doubts about the ability of social media to hold polite informed discussions. One consideration is to setup a WhatsApp group that any constituent could join discussing key issues. Currently monthly Council meetings are live streamed, and I would advocate that committee meetings are also live streamed. Council should be as transparent as legally possible. 
Council alone cannot do everything but in partnership with residents and groups across the Shire we can make a substantive impact on the issues that affect us. One thing Council can do is an audit of funding opportunities, how often has Council and communities have applied for a grant and what the success rate has been, and then plan on how to increase the success rate to help both Council and communities obtain the resources they require to manage where they wish to be.
In the 1990’s I was engaged in forming local government which brought Black and White voters together. Fifteen years ago I was project director on an AusAID-funded democratic governance program in eastern Indonesia.
","This is a bread-and-butter practice given my three decades experience in community development applying strength-based approaches. We are all unique intelligent people with our own thoughts and concepts, and there is a skill bringing these together to build on commonalities. It demands astute listening and empathy, especially when one’s own views are contradicted. A Councillor has their own ethical framework, and I describe mine as ‘social justice progressive’, they have an obligation to consider all constituent perspectives, and then they must negotiate with other Councillors. Compromise is inevitable and it is a fine art to lead to a productive solution.
Since COVID the world has been going through an angry space, and there is plenty to be upset about. Mental health issues have increased, as an example studies in the US and Australia have recorded a surge in road rage, and there is a trend towards ‘anger politics.’ People seeking to be community leaders have a responsibility to be caring and empathetic, while standing up to extremes in hostility.
","‘Resilient community’ typically refers the ability to cope with extreme adverse events, such as natural disasters. I have prior work experience with international humanitarian organisations, currently volunteer with an emergency service organisation, and did my Master’s thesis on community-based disaster management. I would like to bring these attributes to contribute at governance level.
Council has a small but highly effective emergency response team and already do good work in this area. Their arrangements with MASDAG are an example, as is the post-flood activities they are running with West End, Newstead and Campbell’s Creek communities. This work should continue to be supported and strengthened.
‘Resilient community’ can also refer to self-sufficiency and sustainability, and our Shire has massive skills and assets that we can bring together for mutual support to grow our community. This is through the arts, our relationships, our economy, our care and respect for those around us and further afield. In this sense Council is a facilitator, empowering our multiple communities to set and achieve their goals within an all-of-us framework.
",,"I commit to advocating for this and to gain the support of other Councillors to do so. We also need to run a public information program, including staff training, to promote awareness and acceptance of trans and gender diverse people. ","I have taken the Rainbow Pledge. It is disappointing that not one candidate in 2020 fully supported the Rainbow Pledge, but they must be on a learning curve because Council has flown the rainbow and trans flags, participate in Pride events, etc. Progress has been made, and the journey has started and I commit to continuing on that pathway.",Yes,"Massive respect to the people of Castlemaine Safe Space (CSS) and the superb work they do. I support the financial sustainability of the group. Advocacy and planning has to be done in partnership with the volunteers and members of CSS, targeting all tiers of government, philanthropic agencies, etc. ",Yes,"Housing at all levels is in crisis across the Shire and country, and Council must make a concerted effort within its mandate to address the issue in multiple ways. One aspect of homelessness is simply to have a bed for the night, which is a fundamental human right, and this could be provided through a services organisation being supported to provide dormitory or single room accommodation. Some European countries are utilising sleeping pods, and this should be investigated. ","The climate crisis is the proverbial dinosaur in the tea shop, with potential to eradicate all life on this planet. Even if we could reduce CO2 emissions to zero today, the situation will get much worse before it gets better. This is a legacy of industrialisation. Council is providing strong leadership with their Net Zero 2025 strategy. The limitation is that we are one council with limited resources when a whole-of-global response is required. We must make our contribution which provides leadership to others to join us.",Yes,"Most definitely we require a stronger response at State and Federal levels. No new investment in any fossil fuels is a prerequisite, and rapid transition to a fossil fuel free renewable economy is essential.
Newstead community got themselves organised and gained a $1 million state government grant to install a solar farm with a community battery. This means zero carbon outputs, massively reduced expenses, and the capacity to continue community power supply even when a disaster brings down mainstream power lines. Council can be advocating to state and federal governments to make more of those grants available and going out to assist communities to organise and apply for a grant.
","Council is not obliged to adopt policy positions on any particular subject, as the explanatory notes to their resolution references. If I had been a Councillor, then I would have supported Council adopting a position in support of the Voice in last year’s referendum. There are some principles that apply universally and here which includes adherence to all human rights provisions, the right to self-determination, and the right to live in peace and safety, and these should guide all Council decisions.","I have transferred my own superannuation from an industry fund to a fully ethical one. I support the council default super fund being one that across its entire portfolio has no investments in defence/weapons, fossil fuels, gambling, alcohol, or tobacco. In investigating options and implementing findings it is essential that unions are involved and endorse any decision (in a previous existence I was a shop steward / organiser and I remain a unionist at heart).",I commit to the principle asked in the question. I am not sure how to do this but undertake to investigate and transparently report findings and discuss the best way forward.,Refer below,"This is a question close to my heart and social justice activist history. In the 1970’s I was a founding member of the Palestine Human Rights Campaign, which produced the Free Palestine newspaper. In the 1980’s I travelled through the region between the river and the sea. I spent the 1990’s in South Africa and was there for the brilliance of liberation, which has given me insights on the similarities and differences between the South African and Israeli versions of apartheid. In the 2000’s I worked with international humanitarian organisations, and I have seen the tragedy of war. 
Since the horror of October 7 and Israel’s genocidal response there has been a phenomenal growth of public opposition to the reactionary nature of Israel’s government. 
In considering Council’s role I would make 5 points:
1.	The first task is to be calling for an unconditional immediate Ceasefire Now. Just stop the killing now. 
2.	The definition of terrorism I use is ‘Any military action targeting a civilian population to produce a political outcome.’ It can be applied equally to both state and non-state actors. Whether the crimes are systemic and institutional or a singular event, all breaches of international humanitarian law are immoral and to be condemned, no matter who commits them. 
3.	The Shire has residents of different perspectives and values who have been affected and are traumatised by events between the river and the sea (and now further north), and Council has a duty of care for their mental health. 
4.	Within the current despair and bleakness there are a few candles, some hands reaching across the apartheid wall, and I acknowledge the brave actions by members of B’Tselem, Breaking The Silence, Standing Together, Parents Circle – Families Forum, Combatants for Peace, the Palestinian Women of the Sun and their Israeli counterpart Women for Peace. We should be seeking to strengthen those hands so they can tear the apartheid wall down. South Africa taught us that international allies are crucial but ultimately freedom can only be achieved by those who live there.
5.	As a Council and being a welcoming community, we can be going to federal government saying we will take refugees from Gaza to give them a safe refuge (and Sudan as well, because there is a genocide happening there and no-one is watching).
",Yes,"As a Shire we are a bit of a contradiction because we are a very welcoming community yet remain predominantly Anglo-Celtic and our speed of demographic transition is not at the pace of some of our neighbours. Recently I spent five years performing contracts with Greater Bendigo Council’s Community Partnerships Unit, including implementing aspects of their cultural diversity and inclusion plan. They are approaching the point to potentially move onto the next level.
At Council we have an excellent Community Partnerships Unit (CPU), with great staff that I have worked alongside in different ways. As a councillor I commit full support to CPU, demographic change in the Shire, and Council leading this through cultural diversity and inclusion in a manner that best suits our specific context. I have the perspectives and skills to bring that to fruition.
",Yes,I commit to the principle asked in the question. I commit to investigate and transparently report findings and discuss the best way forward.,"Yes, I endorse. If it does not exist yet council can add a stipulation that any decision on social and affordable housing must include a minimum provision for people with physical and/or intellectual disability.","Yes, I am aware of the DIAP and am fully supportive of it along with the partnership between council and MASDAG. I am pleased that Council continues to directly engage care workers, rather than privatising the service.",Yes,"Housing is one of the first three steps on the humanitarian ladder – the right to food, water, shelter. Traditionally in Australia it has been the primary means for families to have security and generate wealth. Increasingly people are being denied that opportunity and within Council’s powers we need to do what we can to fix it.
Housing in all its forms is a primary issue across the Shire and the whole country. MHN is an excellent initiative involving multiple organisations, and I’m also very supportive of the Affordable Housing Trust that Council has established. We need to be innovative finding a range of affordable solutions while maintaining standards. I would be interested in finding out more about the solar bank concept.
Our demographic is changing where we are one of the oldest age populations amongst Victoria’s councils, while we also have young families moving in. There are houses now too large for the aged inhabitants, who want to remain here because of their relationships and ties. One possible option would be clusters of small self-contained units with communal space, which elderly residents can move into freeing up multi bedroomed houses for the next generations. The Older Women in Cohousing Inc (WINC) is an excellent example of what is possible and Council should be nurturing similar initiatives.
",Yes,If it has not yet been prepared then the first step is to produce a report on different connections to housing across Council departments with recommendations on the best way to improve collaboration and gain integration.,Yes,"There have been many technological advances which means we can be innovative and flexible on housing arrangements and waste management, while maintaining environmental and safety standards.",Yes,"In principle I am in agreement. As a Councillor I would seek further information on the specifics. For example, why are these dwellings vacant and what capacity does Council have to induce the owners to make them available?",Yes,"It is a sad situation when as a country we take pride in armaments displays and exports, as shown by the Melbourne’s recent weapons expo, which are used in war causing people to flee, and then when they arrive with us seeking refuge, we lock them up in offshore gulags.  Great respect to RAR and their committed team of volunteers. I have implemented activities with LCMS. I commit to reviewing and refreshing the action plan.","Having spent several years living and working in non-Western cultures I can attest to the depth and brilliance of what we here describe as multi-culturalism and how it adds to our growth and humanity. It has certainly made me a better, more insightful and holistic person.
I have prior experience working with Greater Bendigo Council implementing their cultural diversity and inclusion plan, and lessons learnt which be applied here. Our Council already is taking strides and their partnership with Loddon Campaspe Multicultural Services to hold Zinda Festival here is a really positive start. We are a welcoming community and I am hopeful that our demographics will adapt to align with what Australia elsewhere has become.
As stated previously, Council with the community should be going to the federal government saying we will take some refugees from Gaza and provide them with a safe haven. The same applies for Sudan where a genocide is also happening.
","Allow me to begin by acknowledging how fortunate we are to reside on Djaara country, and the beauty and safety this land offers. I pay my respects to the Traditional Custodians with their continued practice of custom and connection to Country.
Politicians and horror writers love to use fear because it is a powerful emotion, so here’s my pitch: The world is in a challenging time. Post COVID there is a surge of anger and people’s mental health is being impacted. The climate emergency and other factors are smashing the boundaries of a finite planet. We lurch from economic crisis to economic crisis with inequality at unprecedented levels along. Along with job insecurity and the rise of the gig economy people leave university with HECs debts larger than mortgages. There is growth of an extreme-right with the rise of neo-fascism in some parts of the world. The pace of technological change is outstripping our ability to establish ethical boundaries. 
In the Shire we are being impacted by these challenges – the hailstorm a couple of weeks back and the floods 2 years ago are a taster of what’s coming – and we have a community able to meet them. One of the reasons we love living here is that between us we have a massive range of skills, and we care for each other – today’s forum is an example, and the questions asked relate to the issues that we face.
Local government might be the tier of government closest to the people, and while it has the limited resources it can provide leadership, build partnerships, manage delivery, and advocate to other levels of government. There is much this Shire does which is excellent and we should seek to maintain and strengthen – net carbon zero 2025, Indigenous Round Table, Affordable Housing Trust, retaining community care services within Council. There are a myriad of excellent community organisations and initiatives such as the ones here today council can be strengthening partnerships with, and I will talk specifically to participatory democracy in response to a submitted question. 
There is also a rare opportunity to let in some fresh air and produce a transformative Council, and I bring the life experience and skills to be an integral part of the team doing that. Ongoing collaboration with the organisations that have come together to organise this Forum would be a major step. At least three councillors will be new and there is possibility that it could be a majority, and I certainly hope it is. Which means when the elections are over then the work really starts because Council has a role across multiple issues that build our self-sufficiency and sustainability.
Several months ago, I decided that I would love to contribute to this community by being a councillor. I am a lifelong social justice campaigner across multiple sectors. For three decades I have been a community development specialist internationally, in other parts of Australia, and with a local government, successfully applying strength-based approaches – the principle being people should be involved on an ongoing basis in the decisions that affect their lives. I am an active member of several community organisations. I would really love to bring these skills and knowledge to contribute at local governance level. 
","This year, during Reconciliation Week, the Chewton Primary School students put on an amazing exhibition around truth telling and reconciliation, which stretched from the school to Me-Mandook Galk. It was a profound example of hthe results of honest constructive education.
Our Shire was a light in that we voted Yes in the Voice referendum, which I actively supported. It was not an overwhelming vote, and we must recognise that racism in our community exists, targeting First Nations and others. Council can play a constructive role, in active partnership with stakeholders, being overtly anti-racist and progressively inclusive, in its actions and statements. It can provide leadership on truth telling and steps towards Treaty. 
Truth telling can be both traumatic and liberating and needs to be undertaken sensitively, especially as the colonisation impact continues to this day. I was living in South Africa at the time of their Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and for the victims’ families it was cleansing to be discover what really happened to their loved ones, while for many beneficiaries of South African apartheid it was illuminating to find out what had been done in their name. Ultimately it was unifying.
European wealth is based on colonial exploitation, starting with the Atlantic slave trade, and it enabled the establishment of the Australian nation-state. I am committed to redress of that inheritance.
",Yes,Yes,"Yes, and the corollary to Discrimination Action is Positive Inclusion which can also be included.
The important phrase here is ‘engaging with and supporting’ LGBTQIA+ youth, plus LGBTIA+ people of all ages I would add, so it is their plan and we work in partnership.
",Yes,"The Shire has a key leadership role within the broader community by helping with education and awareness raising initiatives around Treaty and why it is important, what it means to our community and to Victoria. Important that all Councils, including ours, remains up to date with the Treaty Process and that we link in closely with Reconciliation Victoria and local Reconciliation and allies’ groups across the region. We all play a key role in preparing our community as Treaty process progresses. 
One thing that Council can do, in partnership with Traditional Owners and First Nations groups, is to lead a Shire-wide pledge in support of Treaty that is supported by schools, organisations, businesses, and other groups. We can support truth-telling through commissioning community narratives of local history along with promotion of Traditional Owner language across the landscape. 
","As a councillor, I would continue support for the Indigenous Roundtable and to always be led by Uncle Rick and Traditional Owners and First Nations community voices on this Roundtable and elsewhere. Council’s Reconciliation Action Plan and 2024 Commitment to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Peoples of the Shire has to be at the forefront of all our work.
There will be several new councillors, and the ones I know share the commitment of support to a collaborative approach with First Nations residents, and as incoming councillors a focus has to be learning and relationship building. We can strengthen ties through the Indigenous Roundtable (an annual dinner perhaps), cultural awareness training, attendance at the Australia Day / Survival Day ceremony. We can really focus on achieving better outcomes in employment and procurement for First Nations people.
",Yes,"The 2023-26 Middle Years Plan is another example of Council working in partnership with key audiences, and I support it. I trust Council has specialist staff overseeing implementation of the Plan and, in conjunction with Youth Council and middle years representatives, I would seek their advice on how to ensure the recommendations are efficiently delivered. I would also ensure Council provides reports to them on progress and challenges.","Given the general state of the world, it is not surprising young people face mental health and wellbeing difficulties. As a councillor, I commit to fixing that up as much as I can.
Council has a particular responsibility towards the generations coming up. I would reference support for the 2023-26 Middle Years Plan and successful implementation of it, which must be done in partnership with young people. One area of concern are recreational facilities and climate change, as sports fields, skate parks and food gardens are inundated by flood waters or exposed to heat waves. Council needs to find a way to climate proof these venues so their ongoing use can be maintained, and to provide recreational activities that suit young people. We are a renowned arts community in all its forms, and this enables a creative outlet for people to express themselves. We are blessed to be surrounded by national parks so we can refresh by immersing ourselves in the natural environment.
","The Youth Council is a great starting point, guiding Council on the needs and interests of young people. Councillors and council staff can go and meet with young people where they gather, hearing of their concerns and interests, and have them leading processes to provide solutions.
We have the deepest of responsibilities to ensure that we world upcoming generations inherit is better than the one now. As a lifelong social justice campaigner with a world of experience and some successes to claim, this is my commitment and the reason I am standing for Council.
","My own learning is a continuous process. In the last few years, I have undertaken Cultural 
Sensitivity training, Bystander training, on Country tours led by Traditional Owners, and I have just completed Bain Attwood’s book on the colonisation of Dja Dja Wurrung Country. Currently I am reading David Marr’s book on the Frontier Police and Attwood’s book on William Gibson, and I seek for further opportunities to engage and learn.
Personally, the bulk of my activity is directed at challenging racist concepts and belief within the White community, be it directed at First Nations people or those from non-Anglo backgrounds. I am a member of the Bendigo Reconciliation committee and was an active campaigner for the Voice.
My most recent professional activity has been contracts with Greater Bendigo Council on multicultural and First Nations issues. The first contract was providing support to the Muslim community as they prepared to start building Bendigo’s first Mosque. On three occasions I organised the Central Victorian Indigenous Film Festival, including in 2022 when Theatre Royal kindly agreed to screen Fighting Giants, a movie against fracking in the Kimberley.
Prior to arriving here, I spent a few years in the Kimberley, working as the anti-fracking coordinator with Environs Kimberley, collaborating with Traditional Owners. I also undertook strategic development and program establishment work with Men’s Outreach Services, an Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisation.
These are some of the capacities I would bring to truth telling and learning at local governance level embracing the whole shire.
","I am fully in support cultural awareness and anti-racism training across all tiers of Council, inclusive of councillors, directors and all tiers of staff. Cultural self-awareness is powerful because it helps us to examine our beliefs, values and perspectives, along with the systemic issues that generate privilege and disadvantage, and on this basis can commit to redress. It is a bridge towards truth telling.
In 2020-21, working with Greater Bendigo Council, I oversaw successful delivery of Understanding Islam training to Council staff, plus I was involved in rolling out cultural self-reflections and anti-racism training to other council staff. Due to that connection, I have been active in the Bendigo Reconciliation Committee, and I campaigned for the Voice in last years referendum.
","Local Government can provide a critical leadership role supporting Treaty and helping inform the broader community about its significant benefits to Victoria. This includes greater mutual respect and shared understanding of our history, improving cultural rights and recognition, and improvements to health, education and economic opportunities.  ",,

Sometimes those views are expressed quite forcefully, and I not only seek to listen and bring others together, but I almost always enjoy the experience.","I believe a wide awareness of what is happening in our community (even amongst those who are not directly involved) is the most important thing. Council can support this by communicating frequently and widely, and encouraging the engagement of our whole community by showing how they can be involved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wherever possible, I will encourage our Council to work with local companies. I hope that this will naturally cut any connections we may have with larger companies which are less transparent in their dealings with other governments and countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Having grown up and always worked here, I'm keen to see our historical towns and beautiful natural environment preserved, even as we deal with the challenge of growth. 
I believe Council's first responsibility is to maintain our local services and infrastructure, rather than worrying ourselves over State and Federal government affairs - especially international ones.
I want to be part of a Council that keeps our services running, our environment clean, our roads graded/sealed, and our rates low.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I appreciate the commitment and care that has gone into developing these opportunities for candidates to demonstrate their positions on a range of issues. 

Please see my webpage www.rosaliehastwell.com for a broad outline of my approach and principles, why I have nominated and my background. 

I believe that sustainable community-led solutions are best developed collaboratively and with the opportunity to listen to differing points of view and ideas. As an independent Councillor I will need to understand and consider diverse perspectives within the community as well as Council's capacity and authority to implement or support solutions. Many of the issues raised in this questionnaire align closely with my values and principles and/or include key areas in which I have worked professionally and as an active community contributor. These include for example Reconciliation, inclusion and diversity, and refugees.

In line with my commitment to be an open minded candidate and to demonstrate good governance I have decided not to respond with detailed policy positions and commitments through online surveys and questionnaires. 

I am always happy to invite groups and people to contact me and/or Council for a discussion about local issues that fall within my ward and within the remit. I look forward to meeting and working with a wide range of groups across the Shire, over the next four years towards a cohesive, sustainable, fair and resilient community. ",See above,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10/1/2024 9:47:58,,Yes,"I would advocate working with Traditional owners to engage in two way learning and two way science on how to care for Country/environment by using fire as a tool to heal Country/environment as well as prevent bushfires.  The blending of both Traditional ecological knowledge and western knowledge is important to understanding how we can protect our human life, our homes and the environment.",,,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,,,kellyannforcoliban@gmail.com,Kelly Ann Blake,Coliban,,"I would take up opportunities to be involved in community events i.e. spring ball, LGBTQIA+ events and other events or festivals. I would like to get to know other communities who live here and their cultures also.

Listening posts (Fryerstown school) and Chewton Post office Coffee shelter.","I believe in trying to find a middle ground and a way forward to walk together despite different perspectives and values.

I believe people who bring different perspectives or who see things through a different lens can often have a more creative and strengthened relationship which leads to amazing and ‘out of the box’ outcomes.

My working experience over the last 10 years has included working with people from all different backgrounds and differing opinions that has required maintaining a middle ground to reach a sustainable outcome for everyone.","A resilient community is one that ‘walks together’. In a perfect world resilience relies on positive and meaningful collaboration with one another, and deep listening to community.  A resilient community is one that has secure housing, safe places, accessibility to services such as advocacy  for all people. No one should be left behind.",,"We are all people who need our basic human rights to be upheld as per the UNESCO guidelines as outlined in your question.  The right to healthcare services, equal opportunities and safe spaces.  This should not even be a question, this should be happening already. I would strongly advocate for these issues.

I am aware of the Mount Alexander LGBTIQA+ Steering Group, and if the opportunity were to arise I would love to have an open and honest conversation about what the community needs and how I can assist with breaking down barriers.","I took the pledge and I support the 5 priorities.  However, if there were to be a rainbow crossing I would like to advocate for an Indigenous/Aboriginal themed crossing as well.",Yes,"I would investigate future funding opportunities with Council in line with their budget and seek out advice in exploring avenues to continue the support of this valuable resource for our community. I currently do not have experience with social services or community services, however this is a living challenge in our community and I see it happening, and agree that this initiative needs to be supported and ongoing, and I will try my best to realise and advocate for this great initiative.",,"I would find out what is currently being done to address this.

I currently do not have experience with social services or community services, however this is a living challenge in our community and I see it happening. I support the MHN + Castlemaine Safe Space, and I will continuously advocate for these types of programs and initiatives.

I am aware that there is a real need for this and it is important to see what kind of role MASC can play in housing support and other social services, such as DV support, Single Parents and Carer support, Disability support and Elderly/Pensioner support.","I would strongly advocate for our ward and shire to be plastic bag free towns, more electric chargers for eco cars, more safe bike lanes, encouraging people to use farmers markets and green grocers, and limit council’s own emissions.

Also acknowledging that climate change, and the increased risk of fire/heat/flood/food scarcity etc is a justice and equity issue often impacting the worst those who are most marginalised in the community - so we need to ensure a just transition.

I would be advocating for supporting First Nations people in caring for Country as this is to the benefit of everyone, especially in times of increased climate precarity.  We need to bring everyone along for the changes that are needed.",Yes,"Happy to advocate for our communities at the state and federal level to create change and awareness.

I understand that council play an important role in seeing what change can be done with community on a local level that can inspire and set a precedent for state and federal level.","I need to familiarise myself with this policy. Council would have to find out how it is impacting community and engage in community consultation.

I recognise that we all have a part to play in creating a more ‘just’ world and a livable planet for future generations.

The issues of climate change show us the connection between the local and the global and how the seemingly small actions and advocacy on a local level can be part of bigger change on a global level.  Similarly the global climate crisis is already having a very local effect on residents here - with more floods, fires, extreme heat and food shortages and economic impact. Predicted to get worse in the years to come.",I would definitely advocate for.  This can be discussed with CEO and fellow councillors to find out if it has been considered and is possible. It is important to be moving away from fossil fuel projects.,"I will ask the questions that need to be asked, and try my best to ensure accountability by advocating and pushing for transparency",,"I am hearing the pain and anguish that local community are going through in witnessing the horrors of what is happening in Palestine. I’m here to listen to what messages community want me to bring to the table, learning more and going from there.",Yes,I would commit to strongly advocating for a Cultural Diversity and Inclusion as a priority. Especially as I would like to see this in relation to an Indigenous Employment strategy and so all members of the community feel welcome and culturally safe. As we move into the future it is important that we adapt and learn from the diversity of our community. I would however need the support of the other councillors to pass such a motion.,,"This would be a step by step situation. I wouldn’t be fearful to express what the people want. If I was elected I see my role to be ‘Byaa’ which means messenger in Wadawurrung, I would be the conduit to bring peoples voices to the table and strongly advocate for them. I am committed to the upholding of human rights - my whole work and life is about advocating for the rights of Community and Country. I would advocate for transparency to ensure the companies and financial institutions council engage are ethical and follow human rights.","Absolutely because I live it everyday because of my own identified disability having being diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder 7 years ago, and I also have children that have identified disabilities. I can closely relate to the need expressed from this organisation.

I would also encourage and support the cross pollination, collaboration and relationship building between organisations with shared needs and interests - in this case as it relates to housing - whilst acknowledging the ongoing challenges they face.","Yes, because of my experience with my own identified disability I understand the need for work access plans to support my ways of working. I also understand and would strongly advocate for breaking down of these barriers to ensure that all people with different abilities are supported in the ways they need and want.",Yes,"Yes because I believe sustainable and eco-friendly options for housing for community.

I have heard some of the great new initiatives are already underway through My Home Network to address the urgent housing crisis and believe that when council and community groups work together great things can happen.

I believe affordable housing is really important so residents are not priced out of the community.

Too many people are living with housing insecurity.  I believe there should be more affordable ecological housing options, keeping social and inclusive needs in mind to support people.
",Yes,"I feel it’s really important that council and community groups work together and communicate well so that the intersecting issues affecting residents and the environment can be met in a holistic way, so everyone's needs are met and resources and funding is not wasted.",Yes,"On-site waste management would need to be explored and discussed which is part of planning and environmental health. I support the advocacy to Council.

With the increasing economic and housing pressures placed on many residents it is important to be thinking creatively and ‘out of the box’ about how we can cater for the needs of residents and the environment.

I understand the importance of reviewing local laws to see where changes could be made to benefit the changing times we are living in and to support the wellbeing of people and our planet. I think the Tiny Homes local laws that have been passed so far are a great first step. 
",Yes,"This sounds like a great idea. It is a shame to learn that there are so many vacant houses when we are in a housing crisis and so many people are having to move away from family, friends, and work due to the lack of affordable housing available.",Yes,"I would have to learn all about it. However, I believe it is important to ensure the Shire is a welcoming and inclusive place.

I feel it is important to understand what we can do on a local level to support those in need and the ways this can benefit the whole community.  I imagine that council creating and adopting a Cultural Diversity and Inclusion plan could also be a place to state the communities and councils intention to support and advocate for refugees - working with Rural Australians for Refugees Castlemaine and Loddon Campaspe Multicultural Services.
",I would advocate for the creation and adoption of a Cultural Diversity and Inclusion Plan. Advocate and support community groups and advocacy already happening and attend events that celebrate Cultural diversity within the shire.,"First and foremost, I love where I live! I have walked this Country since I can remember and I have a deep connection to my home town, Fryerstown which I call ‘place of windy song’. I would like to see our environment being cared for, and healing of Country.  Through a First Nations and Council co-lead and co-designed biodiversity strategy we can create opportunities for all voices to be heard from our communities, including the youth voices, to hear what they see as important in looking after our environment and loving where we live. I am passionate about habitat for wildlife and maintaining small town character, including Aboriginal Cultural heritage and historical heritage, both are important and are a part of our shared history.

I also strongly believe that I would represent our ward through strong advocacy, transparency, whilst always maintaining our community values.","Yes, I hear you and feel you and all of what community is experiencing. As a First Nations woman who has children in the shire who has been subjected to racism, I believe in calling it out, standing strong and finding more opportunities for truth telling and educating our communities.

Through initiatives where First Nations people and allies/wider community to ‘koling wadangitj’ (walk together) as a collective.  
These could include school based initiatives to promote and support Indigenous education delivery in our local schools, working closely with the KESOs Korrie Education Support Officers, as well as other community initiatives like co-led, co-designed projects such as the Mount Alexander Shire Biodiversity strategy.

More signage, dual language places and interpretations of places and spaces within our shire which focus on First Nations stories and perspectives and then linking or noting the historical story of place with a narrative that does not erase or soften truth telling.

By committing to these seemingly small acts, this will promote and bring more awareness to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander presence in our community, and recognise/acknowledge our first peoples here, Djarra.
",Yes,Yes,"As a bisexual woman I know how important it is to feel safe within community.  I have experienced this hate treatment before when I was in a same sex relationship. I know how it feels, and it is harmful. It is a basic human right to feel safe, acknowledged and heard. I can only imagine how difficult it can be for young people facing these issues like hate speech and discrimination which is why I would support and highly advocate for a Discrimination Action Plan for our shire.",Yes,"I would advocate, and support the preparation for MASC in local Traditional Owner Treaty. Negotiations may include, for example, development of a discussion paper on how Council can engage with the Treaty Negotiation Framework.","As an employee of Wadawurrung Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation and current Director on the board of Nalderun Aboriginal Education Corporation I currently advocate for true and meaningful collaboration with First Nations organisations and community.  I know what this looks like and how it should work.  There is a difference between consultation and true and meaningful collaboration and I encourage partnerships and collaboration. I believe in bespoke collaboration, co-design and partnerships that promote economic advantages to both First Nations communities and the wider benefit to Mt Alexander shire.

I would do my best to keep informed about what is happening in the community through attending the Indigenous Roundtable meetings as well as listening to mob.  I am here to listen and to advocate for these collaborative relationships to continue to be true and meaningful relationships.",,I will review the budget and recommendations within the report and contribute towards the future update of the Middle years plan to 4.,"I would participate in Council’s role as it relates to the Middle Years Plan to 4, by supporting and advocating for ways to overcome the challenges that young people face.","I would advocate for the priorities and challenges raised by our young people within the Middle Years Plan to 4. I would see where it interconnects with the Council plan and other initiatives related to youth within our shire. I would endeavour to visit schools, functions, and community activities to speak with the people who are facing these barriers, and how we can work together.","I would work closely with local First Nations community and Jaara Jaara Elders as well as the Traditional Owner corporation (Djaara) to advocate for first nations human rights, perspectives, and as a collective collaborate with our allies to create truth telling events and ways of shaking up the system for better acknowledgement, respect, and honouring of the truth in schools, workplaces and community in general.

Within the role as Councillor and knowing what I could do at the local level, I would recommend continued education about calling out racism whilst advocating for Cultural safety and cultural inductions in workplaces, schools and within Council.

My family, friends, extended community, and many others have experienced racism during the Yes Campaign.  This is an ongoing lived experience for First Peoples.  I have felt this, I believe in calling it out, I believe in Truth Telling and I already have personally committed to being a truth teller,  truth receiver about racism and contemporary colonisation and assimilation.  It is still happening but under the radar in a sneaky way, and this needs to be called out.","As answered above, I would highly encourage and advocate for Cultural awareness and anti racism awareness being conducted in organisations, schools, areas of hospitality, retail or any place that serves the community within the shire.","As I am not a Traditional Owner of Djarra, I do not have the cultural authority to speak on behalf of their aspirations for Treaty, and as it is Treaty, it may not be appropriate for Council as a local government authority to direct their voice or aspirations on what is a First Nations Initiative at a state level.

What I would do instead, is I would strongly advocate for what our community/local mob wants and needs. I would do my best to share our perspectives through strong truth telling with Council in the hopes that Council would write to First Peoples in expressing their support for Treaty.

I would encourage and promote meaningful conversations with the Traditional Owners’s (Djarra) as the registered Aboriginal Party who holds the seat for their Country and also engage with the elected Assembly members for the North West region, alongside the recently established Elders Voice, to recognise their ambitions for Treaty.",,
