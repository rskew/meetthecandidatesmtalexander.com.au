      <div id="about">
        <p>Allow me to begin by acknowledging how fortunate we are to reside on Djaara country, and the beauty and safety this land offers. I pay my respects to the Traditional Custodians with their continued practice of custom and connection to Country.</p><p>Politicians and horror writers love to use fear because it is a powerful emotion, so here’s my pitch: The world is in a challenging time. Post COVID there is a surge of anger and people’s mental health is being impacted. The climate emergency and other factors are smashing the boundaries of a finite planet. We lurch from economic crisis to economic crisis with inequality at unprecedented levels along. Along with job insecurity and the rise of the gig economy people leave university with HECs debts larger than mortgages. There is growth of an extreme-right with the rise of neo-fascism in some parts of the world. The pace of technological change is outstripping our ability to establish ethical boundaries. </p><p>In the Shire we are being impacted by these challenges – the hailstorm a couple of weeks back and the floods 2 years ago are a taster of what’s coming – and we have a community able to meet them. One of the reasons we love living here is that between us we have a massive range of skills, and we care for each other – today’s forum is an example, and the questions asked relate to the issues that we face.</p><p>Local government might be the tier of government closest to the people, and while it has the limited resources it can provide leadership, build partnerships, manage delivery, and advocate to other levels of government. There is much this Shire does which is excellent and we should seek to maintain and strengthen – net carbon zero 2025, Indigenous Round Table, Affordable Housing Trust, retaining community care services within Council. There are a myriad of excellent community organisations and initiatives such as the ones here today council can be strengthening partnerships with, and I will talk specifically to participatory democracy in response to a submitted question. </p><p>There is also a rare opportunity to let in some fresh air and produce a transformative Council, and I bring the life experience and skills to be an integral part of the team doing that. Ongoing collaboration with the organisations that have come together to organise this Forum would be a major step. At least three councillors will be new and there is possibility that it could be a majority, and I certainly hope it is. Which means when the elections are over then the work really starts because Council has a role across multiple issues that build our self-sufficiency and sustainability.</p><p>Several months ago, I decided that I would love to contribute to this community by being a councillor. I am a lifelong social justice campaigner across multiple sectors. For three decades I have been a community development specialist internationally, in other parts of Australia, and with a local government, successfully applying strength-based approaches – the principle being people should be involved on an ongoing basis in the decisions that affect their lives. I am an active member of several community organisations. I would really love to bring these skills and knowledge to contribute at local governance level. </p><p></p>

                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>This year, during Reconciliation Week, the Chewton Primary School students put on an amazing exhibition around truth telling and reconciliation, which stretched from the school to Me-Mandook Galk. It was a profound example of hthe results of honest constructive education.</p><p>Our Shire was a light in that we voted Yes in the Voice referendum, which I actively supported. It was not an overwhelming vote, and we must recognise that racism in our community exists, targeting First Nations and others. Council can play a constructive role, in active partnership with stakeholders, being overtly anti-racist and progressively inclusive, in its actions and statements. It can provide leadership on truth telling and steps towards Treaty. </p><p>Truth telling can be both traumatic and liberating and needs to be undertaken sensitively, especially as the colonisation impact continues to this day. I was living in South Africa at the time of their Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and for the victims’ families it was cleansing to be discover what really happened to their loved ones, while for many beneficiaries of South African apartheid it was illuminating to find out what had been done in their name. Ultimately it was unifying.</p><p>European wealth is based on colonial exploitation, starting with the Atlantic slave trade, and it enabled the establishment of the Australian nation-state. I am committed to redress of that inheritance.</p><p></p>

                    <p><p><b>Yes</b></p></p><p>My own learning is a continuous process. In the last few years, I have undertaken Cultural </p><p>Sensitivity training, Bystander training, on Country tours led by Traditional Owners, and I have just completed Bain Attwood’s book on the colonisation of Dja Dja Wurrung Country. Currently I am reading David Marr’s book on the Frontier Police and Attwood’s book on William Gibson, and I seek for further opportunities to engage and learn.</p><p>Personally, the bulk of my activity is directed at challenging racist concepts and belief within the White community, be it directed at First Nations people or those from non-Anglo backgrounds. I am a member of the Bendigo Reconciliation committee and was an active campaigner for the Voice.</p><p>My most recent professional activity has been contracts with Greater Bendigo Council on multicultural and First Nations issues. The first contract was providing support to the Muslim community as they prepared to start building Bendigo’s first Mosque. On three occasions I organised the Central Victorian Indigenous Film Festival, including in 2022 when Theatre Royal kindly agreed to screen Fighting Giants, a movie against fracking in the Kimberley.</p><p>Prior to arriving here, I spent a few years in the Kimberley, working as the anti-fracking coordinator with Environs Kimberley, collaborating with Traditional Owners. I also undertook strategic development and program establishment work with Men’s Outreach Services, an Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisation.</p><p>These are some of the capacities I would bring to truth telling and learning at local governance level embracing the whole shire.</p><p></p>

Cultural self-awareness is powerful because it helps us to examine our beliefs, values and perspectives, along with the systemic issues that generate privilege and disadvantage, and on this basis can commit to redress. It is a bridge towards truth telling.</p><p>In 2020-21, working with Greater Bendigo Council, I oversaw successful delivery of Understanding Islam training to Council staff, plus I was involved in rolling out cultural self-reflections and anti-racism training to other council staff. Due to that connection, I have been active in the Bendigo Reconciliation Committee, and I campaigned for the Voice in last years referendum.</p><p></p>

                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>First of all, respect to CCH and all the good work that you do, and the excellent questions that have been submitted. The community house network delivers excellence service and are real active hubs of community connection. There is also a great community house in Maldon, and it would be brilliant if council could nurture the rise of similar hubs in other towns across the Shire.</p><p>There are concepts such as deliberative democracy, participatory democracy, and democratic governance and methodologies that flow from them. I am skilled in the application of many of these methodologies, such as Assets Based Community Development. At operational level within Council, I know that staff use many strength-based tools are applied. </p><p>These principles can also apply at governance level. I consider it essential that councillors retain active contact with the broad community, informing them of issues and canvassing viewpoints and opinions. This needs to be done openly and transparently. One method is to regularly hold Constituent Assemblies, perhaps once or twice a year. This Forum is an example. More so perhaps is to be in regular engagement with the representatives of the organisations that held this Forum and other community organisations in their area of interest. Holding regular ‘listening’ posts and being available to the constituency is a standard and effective mechanism. Regular communication through local media is another, although I have doubts about the ability of social media to hold polite informed discussions. One consideration is to setup a WhatsApp group that any constituent could join discussing key issues. Currently monthly Council meetings are live streamed, and I would advocate that committee meetings are also live streamed. Council should be as transparent as legally possible. </p><p>Council alone cannot do everything but in partnership with residents and groups across the Shire we can make a substantive impact on the issues that affect us. One thing Council can do is an audit of funding opportunities, how often has Council and communities have applied for a grant and what the success rate has been, and then plan on how to increase the success rate to help both Council and communities obtain the resources they require to manage where they wish to be.</p><p>In the 1990’s I was engaged in forming local government which brought Black and White voters together. Fifteen years ago I was project director on an AusAID-funded democratic governance program in eastern Indonesia.</p><p></p>

                    <p>This is a bread-and-butter practice given my three decades experience in community development applying strength-based approaches. We are all unique intelligent people with our own thoughts and concepts, and there is a skill bringing these together to build on commonalities. It demands astute listening and empathy, especially when one’s own views are contradicted. A Councillor has their own ethical framework, and I describe mine as ‘social justice progressive’, they have an obligation to consider all constituent perspectives, and then they must negotiate with other Councillors. Compromise is inevitable and it is a fine art to lead to a productive solution.</p><p>Since COVID the world has been going through an angry space, and there is plenty to be upset about. Mental health issues have increased, as an example studies in the US and Australia have recorded a surge in road rage, and there is a trend towards ‘anger politics.’ People seeking to be community leaders have a responsibility to be caring and empathetic, while standing up to extremes in hostility.</p><p></p>

                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>‘Resilient community’ typically refers the ability to cope with extreme adverse events, such as natural disasters. I have prior work experience with international humanitarian organisations, currently volunteer with an emergency service organisation, and did my Master’s thesis on community-based disaster management. I would like to bring these attributes to contribute at governance level.</p><p>Council has a small but highly effective emergency response team and already do good work in this area. Their arrangements with MASDAG are an example, as is the post-flood activities they are running with West End, Newstead and Campbell’s Creek communities. This work should continue to be supported and strengthened.</p><p>‘Resilient community’ can also refer to self-sufficiency and sustainability, and our Shire has massive skills and assets that we can bring together for mutual support to grow our community. This is through the arts, our relationships, our economy, our care and respect for those around us and further afield. In this sense Council is a facilitator, empowering our multiple communities to set and achieve their goals within an all-of-us framework.</p><p></p>

                  <div class="answer">
                    <p></p><p>This is a question close to my heart and social justice activist history. In the 1970’s I was a founding member of the Palestine Human Rights Campaign, which produced the Free Palestine newspaper. In the 1980’s I travelled through the region between the river and the sea. I spent the 1990’s in South Africa and was there for the brilliance of liberation, which has given me insights on the similarities and differences between the South African and Israeli versions of apartheid. In the 2000’s I worked with international humanitarian organisations, and I have seen the tragedy of war. </p><p>Since the horror of October 7 and Israel’s genocidal response there has been a phenomenal growth of public opposition to the reactionary nature of Israel’s government. </p><p>In considering Council’s role I would make 5 points:</p><p>1.	The first task is to be calling for an unconditional immediate Ceasefire Now. Just stop the killing now. </p><p>2.	The definition of terrorism I use is ‘Any military action targeting a civilian population to produce a political outcome.’ It can be applied equally to both state and non-state actors. Whether the crimes are systemic and institutional or a singular event, all breaches of international humanitarian law are immoral and to be condemned, no matter who commits them. </p><p>3.	The Shire has residents of different perspectives and values who have been affected and are traumatised by events between the river and the sea (and now further north), and Council has a duty of care for their mental health. </p><p>4.	Within the current despair and bleakness there are a few candles, some hands reaching across the apartheid wall, and I acknowledge the brave actions by members of B’Tselem, Breaking The Silence, Standing Together, Parents Circle – Families Forum, Combatants for Peace, the Palestinian Women of the Sun and their Israeli counterpart Women for Peace. We should be seeking to strengthen those hands so they can tear the apartheid wall down. South Africa taught us that international allies are crucial but ultimately freedom can only be achieved by those who live there.</p><p>5.	As a Council and being a welcoming community, we can be going to federal government saying we will take refugees from Gaza to give them a safe refuge (and Sudan as well, because there is a genocide happening there and no-one is watching).</p><p></p>

                    <p><p><b>Yes</b></p></p><p>As a Shire we are a bit of a contradiction because we are a very welcoming community yet remain predominantly Anglo-Celtic and our speed of demographic transition is not at the pace of some of our neighbours. Recently I spent five years performing contracts with Greater Bendigo Council’s Community Partnerships Unit, including implementing aspects of their cultural diversity and inclusion plan. They are approaching the point to potentially move onto the next level.</p><p>At Council we have an excellent Community Partnerships Unit (CPU), with great staff that I have worked alongside in different ways.

                    <p><p><b>Yes</b></p></p><p>Housing is one of the first three steps on the humanitarian ladder – the right to food, water, shelter. Traditionally in Australia it has been the primary means for families to have security and generate wealth. Increasingly people are being denied that opportunity and within Council’s powers we need to do what we can to fix it.</p><p>Housing in all its forms is a primary issue across the Shire and the whole country. MHN is an excellent initiative involving multiple organisations, and I’m also very supportive of the Affordable Housing Trust that Council has established. We need to be innovative finding a range of affordable solutions while maintaining standards. I would be interested in finding out more about the solar bank concept.</p><p>Our demographic is changing where we are one of the oldest age populations amongst Victoria’s councils, while we also have young families moving in. There are houses now too large for the aged inhabitants, who want to remain here because of their relationships and ties. One possible option would be clusters of small self-contained units with communal space, which elderly residents can move into freeing up multi bedroomed houses for the next generations. The Older Women in Cohousing Inc (WINC) is an excellent example of what is possible and Council should be nurturing similar initiatives.</p><p></p>
