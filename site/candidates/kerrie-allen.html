      <div id="about">
        <p>I believe our shire is blessed with many unique assets which make it an outstanding place to live, work and visit. I am passionate about protecting the cultural and heritage values, the "village" feel, sense of community, and the native flora and fauna which few shires are lucky enough to still have. We must carefully balance growth and development, with the impact to these assets, to ensure we don't lose the very things which make this shire special. </p><p></p><p>I have enjoyed decades of senior leadership positions in the corporate world until stopping two years ago to focus on being owner builder (ones choice of superlatives to be inserted here - let's just say I understand what its like to navigate council amongst other things!). I would like to use my skillsets to help promote and protect our shire. In looking at the eight wards, I was struck that the Calder ward is the one which may have the biggest impact socially, economically and environmentally on our shire as a whole in coming years. Harcourt is forecast to see phenomenal growth - the second highest behind Castlemaine in the region. This is both exciting, and scary. We need to get it right.</p><p></p><p>Im a keen researcher of solutions which are working elsewhere. Wildlife corridors and crossings, sustainable development and environmentally friendly housing, ecotourism ventures which place protection of our natural assets at the forefront of everyone's thinking.... these are some ideas I would welcome the opportunity to table.</p><p></p><p>The world is in a troubling place in many ways. I am inspired by our local groups who are passionate about doing what they can to steer things in a positive direction, and am committed to doing what I can to assist.</p>

                    <p>I would like to run listening posts with young people - perhaps in schools where they can drop in confidentially and chat about anything concerning them. I also think we could involve young people in brainstorming solutions to problems - for example how could we devise wildlife-friendly fencing on sheep properties? What could we do about all the uncovered mines in the area? Young people often have fantastic ideas which we could benefit from. And to be included in devising new solutions I think would boost their feelings of self-worth - and rightly so.</p>
